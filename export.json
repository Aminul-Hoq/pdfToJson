A large proportion of our\nrevenue is directly tied to products that require water as a critical ingredient and water is essential to our operational processes, used in each step of production, including\ncleaning, heating and cooling. As we continue to grow our business and increase sales of our products, the amount of our revenue dependent on water will increase and so\nour future water dependency will also continue to increase. However, with continued efforts to reduce our water usage through increased water efficiency and reuse, we aim to\ndecouple volume growth from water use as much as possible. Indirect Use: Good quality water is vital to ensuring a sustainable supply of the agricultural ingredients,\npackaging, and other key materials we use in our products. Through water footprinting studies across our value chain, we know that approximately 85% of the total water\nfootprint of our products comes from our agricultural ingredient supply chain. We also recognize that access to safe water for drinking and sanitation is essential to the\ncommunities where we operate and across our value chain. Our plans to diversify our portfolio and increase volumes in products such as tea, coffee, dairy, fruit and nuts will\nlikely increase our future water dependency in indirect usage, as these ingredients are often highly water intensive. Through our water replenish projects with farmers to\nimprove productive use of water and our sustainable agriculture program, we will continue to work with our agriculture supply chain to improve water management practices\n"

          "details": "Direct use: Our direct use of re-used/recycled water is limited to non-product activities, such as cleaning-in-place processes and water treatment operations, and we directly\nsource very little brackish and/or produced water. Therefore, the direct use importance rating of recycled, brackish and/or produced water is neutral. For recycling processes,\nmany of our facilities across the system have implemented water recovery systems meeting the highest quality standards, and where applicable expanding the use of such\nwater sources, helping minimize our environmental impacts. Future water dependency of this type of water is expected to increase moderately given our ambition to increase\nregenerative water use as part of our 2030 water strategy that is currently being finalized. Indirect use: Recycled, brackish or other types of water can be treated and used in\nour agricultural supply chains, including for irrigation purposes. Continued access to sufficient amounts of such water is important to help to reduce freshwater extraction,\nreducing the impact on water tables, and improving local water availability. This is particularly critical in water stressed areas where we source our ingredients.

      "value": ". We are reporting data across our manufacturing business system. This data does not include water use at sales and management offices or warehouse operations\nas water use in such locations is small compared to manufacturing operations.. Please explain. Direct use: Our direct use of re-used/recycled water is limited to non-product activities, such as cleaning-in-place processes and water treatment operations, and we directly\nsource very little brackish and/or produced water. Therefore, the direct use importance rating of recycled, brackish and/or produced water is neutral. For recycling processes,\nmany of our facilities across the system have implemented water recovery systems meeting the highest quality standards, and where applicable expanding the use of such\nwater sources, helping minimize our environmental impacts. Future water dependency of this type of water is expected to increase moderately given our ambition to increase\nregenerative water use as part of our 2030 water strategy that is currently being finalized. Indirect use: Recycled, brackish or other types of water can be treated and used in\nour agricultural supply chains, including for irrigation purposes. Continued access to sufficient amounts of such water is important to help to reduce freshwater extraction,\nreducing the impact on water tables, and improving local water availability. This is particularly critical in water stressed areas where we source our ingredients. As we continue\nto grow our business, diversify our portfolio and increase our sourcing volumes in products such as tea, coffee, dairy and fruit we expect that our future water dependency on\nthis type of water will increase in our agricultural supply chains. In addition, several of our major sourcing regions are expected to undergo increasing water stress due to the\nimpacts of climate change which will further decrease the amount of available freshwater and increase our reliance on recycled water.

In addition to water, the principal raw materials used in our business are nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners. In the United States, for example, the principal nutritive\nsweetener is high fructose corn syrup (\u201cHFCS\u201d), which is nutritionally equivalent to sugar. The principal nutritive sweetener used by our business outside the United States\nis sucrose, i.e., refined sugar from sugar cane or beet. Our selection of \"sugar\" above represents a combination of both HFCS and sucrose as described here. The\nnutritive sweeteners used in the finished products are purchased, in some cases by The Company and in other cases by our independent bottling partners. This split of\nnutritive sweetener sourcing notwithstanding, 61-80% of our revenue is dependent upon this agricultural commodity. Through water footprinting studies across our value\nchain, we know that approximately 85% of the total water footprint of our products comes from our agricultural ingredient supply chain, particularly farming. We currently\nestimate the water footprint of cane sugar is 1700 l/kg; of corn 1200 l/kg and of beet sugar 920 l/kg; however, the impact of these footprints for sugar differs greatly\ndepending on levels of water-stress and of the presence of irrigation. A Global Enterprise Water Footprint Study, which is being currently undertaken, alongside additional\nrisk assessments to determine water stressed sourcing regions, will further inform our understanding of water impacts of sugar sourcing.. In 2019, juice from oranges (the largest volume of fruit we source by far) accounted for 21-40% of our revenue. Most of our orange juice is procured by a central\nprocurement team, sometimes together with our Coca-Cola bottling partners. Through water footprinting studies across our value chain, we know that approximately 85%\nof the total water footprint of our products comes from our agricultural ingredient supply chain, particularly farming. We estimate that the water footprint of oranges , is 560\nl/kg and most groves are irrigated. The impact of this footprint depends greatly on levels of water-stress. A Global Enterprise Water Footprint Study, being currently\nundertaken, alongside additional risk assessments to determine water stressed sourcing regions, will further inform our understanding of water impacts of orange sourcing..

During 2019, we continued to improve the\nefficiency of our water use. We now need only 1.85 liters of water per liter of final product, an 18% improvement compared to 2010. We achieved this through\ninvestments in technologies which enable greater reuse and recycling as well as increased efficiency, such as: - Industry approved water-efficient technologies in our\nlines to reduce water use in rinsing of our packages. - Replacing the nozzle types used for cleaning operations with a rotary type. - Switching our lines/conveyors to\nuse dry lubricants where possible to avoid water usage in conveyors - Reverse osmosis which allow us to reuse the water for many beneficial uses. So while our\nsales volume increased from 29.6 billion unit cases in 2018 to 30.3 billion our total water withdrawals decreased. At the same time, we have increased water reuse\nand are working on new, transparent metrics for water use going forward.

In 2018/2019 we conducted a global enterprise water risk assessment, using WRI Aqueduct, covering all of the Coca-Cola Systems' production facilities globally and 9 of\nour priority commodities and their sourcing regions. The assessment includes baseline water stress, projected water stress to 2030, water quality challenges and access\nto water and sanitation (WASH) challenges, for direct operations and key agricultural commodities. According to this study, approximately 3%, by weight of oranges\nsourced are grown in watersheds with extremely high baseline water stress. The risk thresholds used are below, and are according to the scoring methodology employed\nby WRI's Aqueduct tool: 0-1 Low (<10%) 1-2 Low -Medium (10-20%) 2-3 Medium -High(20-40%) 3-4 High (40-80%) 4-5 Extremely High (>80%) Therefore, we can say\nthat 3% of oranges we source are grown in watersheds where the total annual water withdrawals are more than 80% of the annual available renewable water supplies. 7 .

In 2018/2019 we conducted a global enterprise water risk assessment, using WRI Aqueduct, covering all of the Coca-Cola System's production\nfacilities globally and 9 of our priority commodities and their sourcing regions. The assessment includes baseline water stress, projected water stress\nto 2030, water quality challenges and access to water and sanitation (WASH) challenges, for direct operations and key agricultural commodities. For\nthe purpose of this report, we will disclose data for the 135 company-owned facilities in 2019. Of these facilities, we identified 24 facilities (for full\ndetails see W4.1b and W5.1) to be located in areas of \"High\" or \"Extremely High\" baseline water stress. We have expanded our definition of \"water\nstressed areas\" from last year to include both High and Extremely high water stress. Baseline water stress is an indicator of competition for water\nresources and is defined informally as the ratio of demand for water by human society divided by available water. It is also commonly known as the\nwithdrawals-to-availability ratio. Baseline water stress measures the ratio of total annual water withdrawals, from industry, domestic and agricultural\nusers, to average annual available renewable supplies. WRI used a long time series of supply (1950\u20132010) to reduce the effect of multi-year climate\ncycles and to allow us to ignore complexities of short-term water storage (e.g. dams, floodplains) for which global operational data is non-existent.\nBaseline water stress thus measures chronic water stress rather than drought stress, and does not include the effects of deep groundwater, water\ngovernance or infrastructure in meeting industrial, domestic and agricultural demands for water. The risk thresholds used are below, and are according\nto the scoring methodology employed by WRI's Aqueduct tool: 0-1 Low (<10%) 1-2 Low -Medium (10-20%) 2-3 Medium -High(20-40%) 3-4 High (40-\n80%) 4-5 Extremely High (>80%) In 2019, 2.6% of company-owned facilities' total water withdrawals were from areas with a High or Extremely High\nbaseline water stress.. % of total\nagricultural\ncommodity\nsourced from\nareas with water\nstress. Currently 3% of the total volume of oranges we source by volume is grown in watersheds with extremely high water stress. The future anticipated trends are that we expect\nthe proportion of our key agricultural commodities, including oranges, sourced from water stressed areas will increase over time. As part of our new 2030 water strategy we\nwill use this data to identify global priority watersheds and set context based targets, key performance indicators, and design and implement projects, including collective\naction & public policy engagement/ advocacy, to improve watershed health.. 12777. 130430.

In geographies, where municipal or other third party infrastructure does not exist for effluent discharge, our production facilities discharge waste water\naccording to the strictest effluent discharge quality guidelines, into fresh surface water. Internal requirements, across our franchise bottling system and\ncompany-owned operations, are for wastewater to be fully treat wastewater prior to discharge if there is no municipal system available or if such\nsystems exist but only have partial treatment. The effluent requirement is that any waste water discharged must be at a level of being able to support\naquatic life. Our water discharge into fresh surface water was about the same in 2019 compared to the previous year with a slight reduction of 565\nmegaliters. The volume has remained roughly the same with a small decrease from the previous reporting year because our overall water usage has\ndecreased slightly, and the discharge volume has followed that trend..

The impacts of these pollutants are on nearby water bodies and watersheds, affecting entire local ecosystems and all water users, including our own bottling facilities as we\ndraw from these watersheds. In our supply chain, our agricultural suppliers could experience detrimental impacts to their own crop yields and impact water users in their\nsurrounding communities, as well as ecosystems, if pollutants are not managed correctly. Some pollutants may impact surface and ground water quality. Fertilizers and other\npollutants could cause a potential change in pH, increase the amount of eutrophication in the water, or depending on the type, cause algae or other microorganisms to grow\nin excess. This could result in impacts on aquatic and natural life across ecosystems and enter watersheds, affecting local fauna as well as broader ecosystems and human\nhealth, as well as potentially disrupting various uses of water, including industrial uses, if untreated.. \f(W-FB3.1a) Describe how your organization minimizes the adverse impacts of potential water pollutants on water ecosystems or human health associated with\nyour food, beverage, and tobacco sector activities.

For this question and W2.2, we are only responding as The Coca-Cola Company, and we do not include\nindependent or franchise bottling partners, or other entities that are not part of The Coca-Cola Company manufacturing operations. Many of our largest independent\nfranchise bottling partners will also be responding to this questionnaire, and from the perspective of their direct operations, will be in a position to respond appropriately to\nthis section. 12 . The risk categories relevant to water quality / pollutants include:. - Water Quality Deterioration and Fluctuation. Acceptability limits are set for discharges directly to the environment following secondary treatment of the wastewater on-site.  If we are discharging to a utility for further\ntreatment, our facilities ensure that we also meet the pre-treatment requirements of such utilities, and the ultimate discharge of the final effluent from those utilities may have\ndifferent discharge limits based on local regulations. Additionally, recommended methods listed below are required for our quarterly compliance checks performed by external\nlabs.

Description of water pollutant and potential impacts\nFood additives are a potential pollutant that is monitored in our operations. Food additives could cause a potential change in pH, increase the amount of eutrophication in\nthe water, or cause algae or other microorganisms to grow in excess. This could result in impacts on aquatic and natural life across ecosystems and enter watersheds,\naffecting local fauna as well as broader ecosystems and human health, as well as potentially disrupting various uses of water, including industrial uses, if untreated.. Description of water pollutant and potential impacts\nFertilizer is used in our supply chain to grow agricultural commodities such as sugar beet and cane sugar, coffee, tea, juices, and others. Potential pollutants impacting\nwater quality include ammonia and nitrates, two of the key pollutants outlined in The Coca-Cola Company's internal Requirements in 2015. As identified in The Coca-Cola\nCompany Water footprint sustainability assessment (WFSA), potential impacts are that nitrate and ammonia from fertilizer entering groundwater as a consequence of\nnitrate leaching from fields into the groundwater where crops are grown. Fertilizer could also pollute via stormwater, or due to improper treatment of wastewater, impacting\nnearby water bodies and watersheds, affecting entire local ecosystems and all water users. Ammonia discharges from sugar plants may also impact surface and ground\nwater quality. Our current data on water pollution risks from agriculture (e.g. the grey water component of the water footprint I sugar beet or oranges) does not show a\nsignificant risk of fertiliser run-off. However, a new enterprise water footprint assessment will provide further granularity of data across the value chain in 2020.. Activity/value chain stage\nAgriculture \u2013 supply chain. Please explain\nOur Supplier Guiding Principles (SGPs) and Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGPs) set out the requirements The Coca-Cola Company expects all of our\nsuppliers to comply with, including requirements on water management (including pollutants), and minimizing water quality impacts from wastewater discharges and\nerosion, and nutrient/agrochemical runoff. One way we encourage suppliers to demonstrate SAGP compliance is to receive certification from sustainable ingredient\nsourcing certification schemes, with which we work together or support. These global sustainable agriculture standards and assurance schemes all include extensive water\nmanagement requirements, including water pollutant management, from measuring abstractions, implementing water efficient irrigation technologies and managing run-off.\nThe Farm Sustainability Assessment of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform, the Bonsucro sustainable sugarcane standard and Rainforest Alliance certifications\nare some of the leading standards we support. Success is measured by tracking the compliance level of our suppliers to our SAGPs. We are currently tracking SAGP\ncompliance of 13 global priority ingredients, which represent about 80% of our total annual agricultural ingredient purchases. In 2019, 54% of these ingredient volumes\nwere SAGP-compliant (up from 8% in 2013, the beginning of the program). In addition to supplier compliance with the Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles, the\ncompany is implementing a range of replenishment projects every year, which contribute to our global water replenishment target. Of the currently contributing projects,\nabout 50 work specifically with farmers in different regions of the world to contribute to reducing run-off or improving water quality. For example, project Catalyst in Australia\nhas been working with Queensland sugar farmers for the past 10 years to improve farming practices that reduce pollution run-off from fields into the waterways and to\nprotect the Great Barrier Reef. In the UK, we are working with our bottler CCEP, the sugar supplier, local farmers and conservation groups to reduce run off from sugar\nbeet farming in East Anglia and to protect the rare Chalk Streams..

For example, in Europe, the business recently led the creation of a business coalition in support ofthe EU Water Framework Directive and is actively engaging with policy makers for preserving a strong regulatory approach to water.. Ensuring all facilities provide fully-functioning, safely managed WASH services for all employees is fundamental to the health, safety and well-being of our employees. Requirementsto this effect are included in our global standard operating procedures (KORE). As a food & beverage business, ensuring advanced WASH practices in all Coca-Cola system facilitiesis critical for product integrity and we monitor for 100% compliance with our internal operating requirements, which includes a full compliance requirement on basic food-safetystandards such as PD ISO/TS 22002-1, Prerequisite Programs on Food Safety, and FSSC 22000. The company also supports the WASH4WORK framework and will continue toreview its guidance and procedures for owned operations, the bottling system and suppliers with regards to WASH for employees.

We are a business-to-business company. Our finished products are sold to customers, which can be very large to very small retailers (grocery stores), restaurants, hotels, cateringcompanies, leisure and entertainment parks etc. As a result, customers' voices and requirements are vital in considering our water-related policies, risks and strategies. The followingare examples of our methods of engagement with customers in water-related risk assessments and relevant examples: - As significant water users in their own operations: forexample, Hotels and catering businesses tend to use a lot of water and we have engaged with a number of our leading customers (e.g. Hilton Group) in the US and Europe to helpthem understand their water risks, share our approaches and advise on water efficiency. - As major indirect users of water through their supply chains, agricultural produce is a majorwater user for many of our retail customers, e.g. in their fresh produce supply chain. We seek to engage customers on sustainable agriculture where we have common supply chains,for example on fruit (for fresh and juice). For example, in Spain (Huelva region), we helped bring together retail customers like Migros and M&S to work with us and our suppliers onwater-efficient strawberry farming. - As a major touchpoint for awareness raising on water with consumers: Retailers are the touchpoint of our brands with the consumers. We engagecustomers to partner on the Point of Sales to raise awareness on water with our consumers. For example, we supported Metro Group in a multi-country consumer activation on worldwater day to raise awareness and funds for water projects in India.. \fInvestors. Relevance&inclusion. Localcommunities. NGOs. Other waterusers at abasin/catchmentlevel. Our investors are important to us and many of our largest institutional investors have had a long engagement with our company. We take their views seriously and have engaged formany years directly on water and other sustainability issues. Investors are critical to our business, as their investment decisions have a direct impact on our business performance.With the financial and regulatory impacts of water potentially increasing, we find that many investors have a strong interest in this topic, and we therefore consider them to be relevantin our water-related risk assessments. In 2018/2019, to enhance our understanding of the impacts of climate change and water-related impacts, we undertook a risk assessmentbased on the framework recommended by the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which has helped us to identify climate and water-related risks andopportunities. This framework is created and promoted by the financial sector, including many of our most influential investors. Method of engagement: As a direct result of using thisframework to assess our future risks, the risk that water-related regulations (e.g. changes in the price of water or restrictions on water supply) may impact our operations has beenidentified as a material risk. This result has been published in our annual Business and Sustainability Report and shared with investors, in line with the recommendations of the TCFD,as a clear financial opportunity to reduce water consumption and enhance water efficiency within our own operations. Another method of engagement is as follows: At least once ayear, we organize an investor engagement day, where we offer investors an opportunity to talk to us about sustainability and water. For example, in September 2019, we organised aworkshop with investors in London in September. In addition, we discuss with investors directly and participate in investor roundtables on water whenever possible, alone or togetherwith other water users, and we disclose our water stewardship work through the annual CDP Water questionnaire.. Civil society/NGOs are a vital part of communities. Many NGOs are our partners in water risk mitigation activities and sharing the value of water resources with communities. Theyprovide a vital input to our policy by reflecting the voice of communities and regulators and helping us establish and maintain strong relationships with those groups. Our primarymethod of engagement with NGOs is through partnerships. For example, in our replenish work, we partner with leading conservation organisations such as WWF and The NatureConservancy (TNC) in many parts of the world (Latin/Central/North America, Europe, China) on watershed protection and resource conservation. For example, the Living DanubePartnership, a unique, cross-sectoral collaboration that brings together World Wildlife Fund, The Coca-Cola Foundation and the Coca-Cola system as well as the InternationalCommission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) and a variety of other stakeholders, is working to protect the unique ecosystem surrounding the Danube River. Through2019, the fifth year of our seven-year commitment to the project, we had restored 30 square kilometers in wetlands in six countries, replenished 15.6 million cubic meters of water andreached nine million people through an outreach campaign. When we work on access to water and sanitation, we work with leading WASH NGO's like WSUP, Wateraid and localcommunity-led NGOs to design and implement the most relevant solutions in the communities. We also partner with NGOs on policy level, for example in the 2030 Water ResourceGroup and national stakeholder roundtables and we also seek to integrate NGO's in industry platforms for sustainable agriculture , for example Field To Market, Bonsucro, SAIPlatform etc.. Regulators. Good water governance is critical to equitable and sustainable water use in the catchments where we operate. Regulators (local, regional and national) are critical to set the rightpolicy frameworks for all water users. On local level, our bottling and distribution facilities are engaged with local regulators, often sharing insights and knowledge on watermanagement with the local water utilities or service providers. Through our source water protection program, we evaluate all government policy, regulations and plans leading to activeengagement at a local and national level. In Europe, water policy frameworks are led by the European Union directives (e,g, EU Water Framework Directive) and we engage with otherpartners, NGOs and users to support a sustainable and robust water resource management in the region. In addition, through international platforms such as the 2030 WaterResource Group or the CEO Water Mandate, we work to support good national water governance in a transparent and multi-stakeholder approach and to raise awareness about itsimportance and best practices on global level.. Relevant,alwaysincluded. Relevant,alwaysincluded. Relevant,alwaysincluded. Statutory special interest groups, in local areas where they exist, are critical stakeholders in enabling us to understand the local nuances of water, as well as the needs of thesurrounding communities. Through the Sourcewater vulnerability assessments (SVAs) and site-level risk assessments, consideration is given to statutory special interest groups. Ourmethod of engagement is through outreach, dialogue and investment in watershed projects to replenish water in the watersheds in which we operate. Our current and forecasted wateruse are assessed via a rights-based approach that assesses social considerations of water and sanitation access. Such assessments are required to be maintained and updated onfive-year intervals, or sooner, as conditions warrant. Communities and water rights holders are the key audience of our local faciltiies water management, which can include, forexample, local farmers, neighboring community settlements or water sports and fishing communities. With more than 900 local operations worldwide, these engagements and specificneeds can be very diverse. For example, in our Capetown water plan, we included the neighboring communities in our water management plan, including working to understand andaddress their water access and sanitation needs. In our UK -based sites, e.g. in the Southeast England area, we worked to engage the local fishermen and riverstrust communities tounderstand how best to enhance the nearby watercourse to also support fishing opportunities. In most of the watershed projects we support as part of our replenish work across theworld, we aim to improve the benefits of the water interventions not only for nature, but also for communities, for example by enhancing opportunities for leisure, tourism, commerce orfood production.. \fPlease explain. Relevant,alwaysincluded. About half of our plants receive water from local municipal suppliers. As such, these local water utilities are key stakeholders, and at the local level across our global system, ouroperational entities engage with them on an ongoing basis. Each bottling facility is required to conduct a site-level survey using the internal, proprietary Facility Water VulnerabilityAssessment tool that covers 72 potential vulnerabilities, spread across 20 risk categories for every site, including assessment of risk related to local water utilities and evaluatingpublic sector local and regional water resource medium and long-term planning. Based on the findings of each local bottling facility, our internal global standards require that allproduction facilities form and train a comprehensive water resource management team, work with expert(s) to complete a source vulnerability assessment (SVA) that inventories theserisks, prepare a source water protection plan (SWPP) with actions, roles, responsibilities and funding needs, and execute the plan, and to review the plan and progress annually. Ourmethod for engagement with local water utilities is through sharing knowledge and best practice. In several regions, for example in sub-saharan Africa, the local water utilies havemajor capability challenges , especially around leakage management, non-revenue water, waste water treatment etc. Our bottling partners (e.g. CCBA, CCHBC) work with the localregulators and utilities to share knowledge and best practice. In Capetown, our local bottler Coca-Cola Peninsula Beverages worked actively with the local utility on developing analternative water supply strategy and to reduce supply pressure on the municipal provider. As part of our access to water program, the RAIN (Replenish Africa Initiative) is supportingwork led by WSUP (Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor, for example in Madagascar, to strengthen the utility of the capital and enable it to expand services to 480.000underserved people.. Relevant,alwaysincluded. W3.3d. In our operations, we have a 4-step process for identifying, assessing and responding to water-related risk Step 2 is to overlay relevant data points such as population data and urbanization rates and to understand and prioritize our work.  Our latest such work is the basis of ourdisclosure in this response, for facilities and ingredient sourcing regions located in areas of water stress. It is repeated on a triennial basis, or as conditions warrant Step 4 is to apply our global standards on water resource sustainability, which, based on findings from the assessments above, require all production facilities to: 1. Form awater resource management team; 2. With expert(s), complete a Source Vulnerability Assessment (SVA) to inventory and fully assess all identified risks; 3. Prepare a SourceWater Protection Plan (SWPP) with actions, roles, responsibilities and funding needs; 4. Implement the SWPP; and 5. Review the SVA and SWPP annually The categorization of water stress-levels resulting from Steps 1 and 2 (WRI Aqueduct water-risk mapping and further prioritization by data overlays) have allowed thebusiness to segment our global facility locations in order of priority, creating the foundation for our business to explore context-based water targets, based on the requirementsof each local context.  Additionally, the local assessments in Steps 3 and 4, following from the water-risk mapping, provide an indication of where and what kinds of projectsthe business should invest in locally, in order to help regenerate watersheds and replenish the water that we use in our operations. For example, much of India faces high toextremely high water stress, according to WRI, and TCCC has 9 owned bottling facilities in the country located in such areas. Taking these outcomes and identifying thespecific, local needs for protecting source water and managing vulnerabilities, the local team has identified a multitude of ongoing initiatives and projects. As one example,capturing seasonal monsoon rains, for example through the construction of check dams and rainwater harvesting structures, is critical in rural area to address flooding andquality impacts of stormwater. Since 2009, The Coca-Cola India Foundation has created more than 13 billion liters of water replenishment potential through 150 communitywater conservation projects, impacting over 600,000 lives across 500+ villages in remote and water-stressed areas across India.. As our method of engagement, we require all agricultural suppliers to adhere to our Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGPs), which set out compliancerequirements for all suppliers, including requirements on water management, and minimizing water quality impacts from wastewater discharges and erosion, andnutrient/agrochemical runoff.  Suppliers demonstrate SAGP compliance primarily by receiving certification from sustainable ingredient sourcing certification schemes withwhom we work together or support. These sustainable agriculture standards and assurance schemes all include extensive water management requirements. The FarmSustainability Assessment of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform, the Bonsucro sustainable sugarcane standard and Rainforest Alliance certifications are some ofthe leading standards we support. Suppliers are audited on their compliance with these principles on a yearly basis. Of our 13 global priority ingredients, in 2019, 54% ofthese ingredient volumes were SAGP-compliant (up from 8% in 2013, the beginning of the program). 19 . W4.1.

The status of ecosystems and habitats in our areas of operation or in our supply chain are essential in ensuring the long-term sustainability and availability of water. If these are\nimpacted or degrade, this could lead to the degradation of sustainable and quality water availability, potentially impacting community well-being, business productivity and levels of\ncost and ability to produce. We have aligned our risk assessment and management processes with the Alliance for Water Stewardship standard. We conduct global water risk\nmapping and plant-level water risk assessments across all facilities to inform our global water strategy on an approximate triennial frequency, across a 10-year risk horizon, which is\nthen reviewed and updated annually. The process involves a detailed, plant-level survey for each facility, extensive geospatial monitoring of various factors affecting water and a risk\nquantification model. The tools used are WRI Aqueduct and our internal, proprietary Facility Water Vulnerability Assessment tool, which collates all historical data and analysis\nconducted since our global program commenced in 2004. First, using WRI Aqueduct, we make a global assessment of all of our operational sites globally and the respective level of\nwater stress or scarcity in the geography in which each site operates. We then conduct a detailed site-level survey using the Facility Water Vulnerability Assessment tool that covers\n72 potential vulnerabilities, spread across 20 risk categories for every site, including assessment of risk related to status of ecosystems and habitats. There are 5 relevant potential\nvulnerabilities considered for this issue across the following risk categories: Watershed Vulnerability, Water Quality Deterioration & Fluctuations, and Community Conflict. Based on\nthe findings, our internal global standards require that all production facilities form and train a comprehensive water resource management team, work with expert(s) to complete a\nsource vulnerability assessment (SVA) that inventories risks specific to our water source, prepare a source water protection plan (SWPP) with actions, roles, responsibilities and\nfunding needs, and execute the plan, and to review the plan and progress annually. In our updated strategy, the health of ecosystems and habitats will be further integrated into our\naction plans to support watershed health, which will be guided by a watershed health scorecard, including ecosystem and habitat aspects.. Status of\necosystems and\nhabitats. The Coca-Cola Company's water leadership was born in India more than two decades ago, following a conflict between our business and the local community over the use of local\nwater resources. This moment led us to examine and better understand water risks to our company and the communities in which we operate, looking well beyond the four walls of our\nfacilities and into our supply chain. It also led to our pioneering goal, established 10 years ago, to replenish the water we used in the production of our beverages. At the time, the goal\nwas a leap of faith. But we met and exceeded it, and other companies have followed suit. We continue to meet and exceed the target each year since 2015 when we first met the\ntarget. As we transition into the next decade of our water strategy, we recognize that it is important to continue performing against the targets that we set for ourselves, as this\ncontinues to form part of our license to operate. We will make water replenishment a contributing factor of achieving overall watershed health and focus action on the most water\nstressed regions.. Please explain. Please explain. Relevant,\nalways\nincluded. Relevant,\nalways\nincluded. Other water users are also critical stakeholders in that we share a common source of water for our respective end uses. As users of a shared resource, it is critical that we work\ntogether to protect the sustainability of this resource. If we do not work constructively to manage the risks associated with this resource, our ability to operate and produce products\ncould be impacted. For example, to support local efforts to galvanise action for water savings in the greater Atlanta region, we signed up to a buisness pledge to save water, which\nengages Coca-Cola and other water users to take concrete steps on water savings in their facilities. Additionally, the Living Danube Partnership, a unique, cross-sectoral collaboration\nthat brings together World Wildlife Fund, The Coca-Cola Foundation and the Coca-Cola system as well as the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River\n(ICPDR) and a variety of other stakeholders, is working to protect the unique ecosystem surrounding the Danube River. Through 2019, the fifth year of our seven-year commitment to\nthe project, we had restored 30 square kilometers in wetlands in six countries, replenished 15.6 million cubic meters of water and reached nine million people through an outreach\ncampaign. Across Latin America, in South Africa, and Kenya, the company is a key driver for the establishment of TNC Waterfunds, a mechanism to bring water users in an economic\narea together for collective action on watershed level. The company has also been a long-tim supporter of the CEO Water Mandate Action Hubs and also recently joined the Water\nResilience Coalition. Collaboration with other users is also taking shape through our sustainable agriculture work, for example in Turkey, Spain and the UK, where TCCC coinvests with\nother companies in sustainable water management practices for farmers through the SAI Platform. Through our source water protection program, including the local Source\nVulnerability Assessments, we evaluate all water users and vulnerabilities at each of our facilities. We seek to engage other users, communities and regulators to raise awareness of\nthe local catchment level water issues and work on solutions together.

Based on the combination of likelihood\nscore  and consequence score, each potential risk event is ranked and management actions are considered.. On the consequence scale, each risk event is considered against 7 factors to arrive at the score: Financial, Strategy and Business Planning, Reputation, Political and\nRegulatory, Health Safety and Environment, Operational objectives, and People.  The risk event is then given a score of 1 to 5: (1 - Insignificant, 2 - Minor, 3 - Moderate, 4 -\nMajor, 5 - Critical). In the likelihood score,  time horizon is one of two inputs to determine the final score, as noted above. The thresholds for time horizon are: 1 (Rare) - greater than 10 years, 2\n(Unlikely) - 6 - 10 years, 3 (Possible) - 3 - 6 years, 4 (Likely) - 1 - 3 years, 5 (Almost Certain) - 0 - 12 months.

Explanation of financial impact\nThe amount listed here is the value of current business revenue that is dependent on only the production facilities OWNED BY The Coca-Cola Company, located in India.\nAssumptions below: - Net operating revenue (publicly reported) for the BIG Operating Group is used as a starting point. - Assumes that revenue impact breaks down\nproportional to share of volume produced at a production facility. Much of this volume information is publicly available information. - The low end of the range assumes that\nonly locations with Extremely High water stress are exposed. - The high end of the range assumes that locations with both High and Extremely High water stress are\nexposed. - Estimated exposure was calculated by taking BIG Operating Group revenue, multiplying the volume share of India, and further multiplying the proportion of total\nvolume of the market, that are produced at the facilities in focus.. Description of response\nWe closely monitor the impact of our water use, and require all plants to comprehensively evaluate local source water vulnerabilities and risk. Each facility is required to\ncomplete a comprehensive risk assessment, composed of 72 risk factors across 21 risk categories on water-related issues, in which the salient issues surrounding its\noperations are comprehensively addressed. The local teams then take the results of this risk assessment, and implement mitigation and management plans. In India, a\nnumber of our bottling facilities lie in areas that considered to be under Extremely High, or High water stress, according to the WRI's aquedeuct tool. As such, the\nmanagement and mitigation actions are focused on increasing water availability and increasing water efficiency. For example, at Mehandiganj plant in Varanasi district of\nUttar Pradesh, local NGOs and Hindustan Coca-Cola installed the first rainwater harvesting project nearly 15 years ago. Since then, the partnership has commissioned 38\nrainwater harvesting structures to recharge ground water. We continue to improve water efficiency in our plants including introducing water reuse technology. Additionally,\nsince 2009, Anandana\u2014The Coca-Cola India Foundation\u2014has created more than 13 billion liters of water replenishment potential through 150 community water\nconservation projects, impacting over 600,000 lives across 500+ villages in remote and water-stressed areas across the country. The projects emphasize community\nparticipation with a focus on women, who often reach supervisory roles in village \u201cPani Samitis\u201d (water committees), to ensure the maintenance and sustainability of the\ncommunity water projects.. Cost of response\n300000000. United States of America. Country/Area & River basin. Type of risk & Primary risk driver. Physical. Company-specific description\nThere is rising demand for key commodities, particularly agricultural commodities on which our business depends. Our business uses a significant volume of corn-derived\nsweetener, high fructose corn syrup, as a sweetener in our beverages in many of key markets, including the United States of America. If the production of corn is impacted,\na significant portion of our product portfolio in this market will be directly impacted, through cost and availability impacts of a key ingredient. Roughly 29% of of our global\nportfolio is now low or no-calories. The remainder of that portfolio uses either sugar or corn-derived sweetener. Specifically, in the United States, these products use corn-\nderived sweeteners, nearly all grown in the United States. Based on our climate-related priority risk assessment, we understand that the chronic physical impacts of climate\nchange, namely changes in precipitation patterns, temperature variability and changes in weather patterns, are expected to have a significant impact on our agricultural\nsupply chains, which will be felt through the variability in the availability and stress of water resources. Through product water footprinting exercises, we also have\nascertained that for some of our products, 80% of our water use sits within the agricultural supply chain, making this portion of our water usage particularly significant. As a\nresult of these assessments, we understand that if the production of corn is impacted in the United States, a significant portion of our product portfolio in the US will be\ndirectly impacted, potentially increasing cost and creating challenges on the availability of sourcing for a key ingredient. We therefore consider the water-related risks in the\ngrowing (i.e. sourcing) of this raw material to be a critical risk to monitor and understand.. Likelihood\nLikely. Are you able to provide a potential financial impact figure?\nYes, an estimated range. Potential financial impact figure - minimum (currency)\n1580000000. Explanation of financial impact\nThis is the amount of current revenue that is dependent specifically on corn sourced from the United States, which is the scope of this risk calculation. Assumptions below: -\nNet operating revenue (public data) for North America Operating Group is used as an input. - USA revenue breaks down proportional to its UC volume share within the NA\nOG. - Global percentage of low or no-calorie beverages in our portfolio (29%) is applicable as an average to the USA market. - Low end of range = exposed to risk only in\nlocations of extremely high water stress. - High end of range = exposed to risk in locations of both high and extremely high water stress. Estimated exposure was calculated\nby taking North America Operating Group revenue, multiplying the volume share of USA, and further applying % of portfolio that use corn-derived sweetener, based on\nassumption above. We then multiply the % of our corn that we believe may be exposed to risk due to water stress based on climate change impacts.. Supplier engagement. Description of response\nIn 2013, we set a goal to more sustainably source our priority ingredients by 2020. Corn is one of our priority ingredients, in the form of High Fructose Corn Syrup. We\nrequire that our suppliers meet our 15 Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGP), which establish the framework for progress and are integrated into governance\nprocurement processes. As a case study specifically on corn, we advance our sustainable sourcing through membership in Field to Market: The Alliance for Sustainable\nAgriculture, through which we work on more sustainable corn production in the United States. With our four biggest corn suppliers, we are aiming to fulfill a 2014\ncommitment to expand the application of Field to Market\u2019s Fieldprint\u00ae Platform, a data-driven tool that quantifies water use, energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and\nother measures of sustainability performance. The target is to engage corn farmers representing 1 million acres by 2020, which would position The Coca-Cola Company\nwith 100% more sustainable corn production in the U.S. market. As a result of such work, our global % of corn sourced from sustainable sources has moved into the 51 -\n75% range, up from 0 - 25% in 2016 and 2017.. Explanation of cost of response\nThe cost of response to this risk is the total annual contribution from The Coca-Cola Company's to select platforms such as Field to Market, or the SAI platform to promote\nthe advancement of sustainable sourcing and raise awareness at a global level. 25 .

Facility-level water accounting. Facility reference number\nFacility 1. Country/Area & River basin. Explanation of financial impact\nIn 2004, we were using 2.7 liters of water to make 1 liter of product. That means that 1 liter of water was in the product and another 1.7 liters was used in the manufacturing\nprocess, mostly for keeping equipment clean. At the end of 2019, we were using 1.85 liters of water to make 1 liter of product. We have done this by investing in water\nefficient technologies and by introducing new technologies which help to reduce our use of water in our worldwide bottling facilities. Through improved water-use efficiency,\nwe estimate we have been able to avoid and estimated US$1 billion cumulatively in costs from 2011 through 2020, through our water efficiency projects, primarily by\nreducing the amount of water purchased, as well as on the associated costs of internal operations and handling of water, as well as fees associated with water discharge..

Our Supplier GuidingPrinciples (SGPs) and Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGPs) set out the requirements The Coca-Cola Company expects all of our suppliers to comply with,including requirements on water management (including pollutants), and minimizing water quality impacts from wastewater discharges and erosion, and nutrient/agrochemicalrunoff.  We work together with and approve certification schemes such as Bonsucro, SAI and others for sustainable ingredient sourcing, all of which include extensive watermanagement requirements, including water pollutant management, from measuring abstractions, implementing water efficient irrigation technologies and managing run-off.   . Risk assessment procedureingredients and producing the packaging and other essential materials that are critical in producing and delivering our products to market. Adverse impacts on water availability orquality in our supply chains could have significant implications in our capability to produce or the cost of our product and therefore the profitability and growth potential of the business.The tools used to assess the implications of water to our key commodities and raw materials are WRI Aqueduct, balanced scorecards with our suppliers, and our internal tracking ofcompliance to our Supplier Agricultural Guiding Principles. First, using WRI Aqueduct, we make a global assessment of the sourcing regions of our agricultural commodities that wepurchase, and the water stress or scarcity of those geographies in order to map and prioritize our efforts. In parallel, we engage with suppliers through our procurement function, inwhich suppliers are assessed through balanced scorecards, which score suppliers on areas including quality, safety, environmental management and sustainability. A key feature ofsupplier engagement is a requirement for all suppliers to adhere to our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGPs), and all agricultural ingredient suppliers to comply with our SustainableAgriculture Guiding Principles (SAGPs), which set out compliance requirements for all suppliers, including requirements on water management, and minimizing water quality impactsfrom wastewater discharges and erosion, and nutrient/agrochemical runoff. Suppliers demonstrate SAGP compliance primarily by receiving certification from sustainable ingredientsourcing certification schemes with whom we work together or support. These sustainable agriculture standards and assurance schemes all include extensive water managementrequirements, including water pollutant management, from measuring abstractions, implementing water efficient irrigation technologies and managing run-off. The Farm SustainabilityAssessment of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform, the Bonsucro sustainable sugarcane standard and Rainforest Alliance certifications are some of the leading standardswe support. Suppliers are audited on their compliance with these principles on a yearly basis.. Other contextualissues, pleasespecify. Employee engagement is critical for the success of our business and the achievement of water goals. We engage our employees across the system to embed our business objectivesin the day-to-day way of doing business, especially as we have such a vast operational footprint. Also, employee engagement surveys show how important our work on sustainability,including water, is for employee loyalty and engagement. Our method of engagement is as follows: We inform and engage employees on water in different ways, through our intranetawareness. environmental awards for our bottlers include water performance and reward best in class and best performer bottlers. As a food & beverage business, ensuringadvanced WASH practices in all Coca-Cola system facilities is critical for product integrity and we monitor for 100% compliance with our internal operating requirements, whichincludes a full compliance requirement on basic food-safety standards such as PD ISO/TS 22002-1, Prerequisite Programs on Food Safety, and FSSC 22000. 17 . Our local communities play a critical role in our social license to operate. Their voice could directly affect our reputation as a business and impact our license to operate. They are acritical element of our water risk assessments, both on enterprise level and on local facility level. Our primary method of engagement with local communities is to understand potentialsocial or community risks that could impact our communities and to engage through dialogue and support for local stakeholders. For example in the greater Atlanta region in the US,we signed up to a business pledge to save water, together with other community partners, to support local efforts to galvanise action for water savings, which engages Coca-Cola andother water users to take concrete steps on water savings in their facilities. Outside the developed countries, the business has worked with hundreds of local implementing partners toAlliance\u2019, \u2018Lazos de Agua\u2019, \u2018Cada gota cuenta\u2019 etc., which are working based on local community engagement and ownership of the solutions. In total, we estimate that theseprograms have helped provide access for 10.6 million people since 2010. Our current and forecasted water use are assessed via a rights-based approach which assesses socialconsiderations of water and sanitation access. Such assessments are required to be maintained and updated on five-year intervals, or sooner, as conditions warrant. For example, ourglobal water risk assessment tool (Nautilus, based on the WRI aqueduct tool) takes globally available data and validates this on local level with the help of our Business Unit expertsand bottlers, also including community specific risks like access to water and sanitation. On facility level, every bottling plant has to conduct regular Source Vulnerability Assessments(SVA) that take into account very local risk factors, including community and social issues but also potential competition for water with other users and requires to engage with thealwaysincluded.

We conduct global water risk mapping and plant-level water risk assessments across all facilities to inform our global water\nstrategy on an approximate triennial frequency, across a 10-year risk horizon, which is then reviewed and updated annually. The process involves a detailed, plant-level survey for\neach facility, extensive geospatial monitoring of various factors affecting water and a risk quantification model. The tools used are WRI Aqueduct and our internal, proprietary Facility\nWater Vulnerability Assessment tool, which collates all historical data and analysis conducted since our global program commenced in 2004. First, using WRI Aqueduct, we make a\nglobal assessment of all of our operational sites globally and the respective level of water stress or scarcity in the geography in which each site operates. Additionally, using the Facility\nWater Vulnerability Assessment Tool, we conduct a detailed site-level survey that covers 72 potential vulnerabilities, spread across 20 risk factors for every site, which includes\nassessment of risk related to water quality, namely through the risk area of \"Incoming Water Quality.\" There are 7 potential vulnerabilities assessed, which are spread between the risk\ncategories of Water Quality Deterioration & Fluctuations, and Ineffective Treatment. Based on the findings, our internal global standards require that all production facilities form and\ntrain a comprehensive water resource management team, work with expert(s) to complete a source vulnerability assessment (SVA) that inventories these risks specific to our water\nsource, prepare a source water protection plan (SWPP) with actions, roles, responsibilities and funding needs, and execute the plan, and to review the plan and progress annually.. W3.3c. Relevant,\nalways\nincluded. Suppliers are essential in enabling our business to produce to demand, as well as to understand the impact that our business has through the value chain. We have worked with our\nsuppliers to understand our water footprint across the value chain, with estimates indicating that the vast majority (upwards of 80%) of the water footprint of some of our products\nreside with the growing and production of our key agricultural ingredients, such as sugar and fruit. We engage with suppliers through our procurement function, in which suppliers are\nassessed through balanced scorecards, which score suppliers on areas including quality, safety, environmental management and sustainability. A key component of this score is a\nrequirement for all suppliers to comply with our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGPs), and all agricultural ingredient suppliers to comply with our Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles\n(SAGPs), which set out requirements for all suppliers, including requirements on water management, minimizing water quality impacts from wastewater discharges and erosion, and\nnutrient/agrochemical runoff. Suppliers demonstrate compliance primarily by receiving certification from sustainable ingredient sourcing certification schemes with whom we work\ntogether or support. These standards and assurance schemes all include extensive water management requirements, including water pollutant management, from measuring\nabstractions, implementing water efficient irrigation technologies and managing run-off. The Farm Sustainability Assessment of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform, the\nBonsucro sustainable sugarcane standard and Rainforest Alliance certifications are some of the leading standards we support. Suppliers are audited on their compliance with these\nprinciples on a yearly basis. We also work to identify specific projects in sourcing areas with high water risk to improve water management and demonstrate the benefits of high-\nefficiency irrigation techniques to farmers. For example, we worked with our smoothie business innocent and the supplier SVZ to advance water efficient berry farming in Spain's\nHuelva region. We also worked with our Spanish Fanta business and the supplier Frusa to improve water efficiency in orange farming in the Valencia region. In India, our business runs\na series of sustainable agriculture projects with its cane sugar suppliers and smallholder farmers to improve access to and management of water in Uttar Pradesh. 18 . Relevant,\nalways\nincluded. In our value chain, we assess the implications of water risk to our key commodities and raw materials first using WRI Aqueduct. We make a global assessment of the sourcing\nregions of our agricultural commodities that we purchase, and the water stress levels of those geographies in order to map and prioritize our efforts. In addition, we apply\nseveral criteria such as spend, strategic importance, and sustainability risk to prioritize the ingredients we track. We are currently tracking 13 global priority ingredients\nrepresenting about 80% of our total annual agricultural ingredient purchases.. The Company has robust internal processes and an effective internal control environment that facilitate the identification and management of risks. At a central level, this is\nconducted primarily by a robust, cross-functional and cross-company (including our bottling partners) Enterprise Risk Management program and Risk Steering Committee,\n which conducts regular assessments of risk, including an annual update of key enterprise risks. Potential risks factors are gathered from across all functions and\norganizations across the global system (group of organizations including our bottling partners), classified within a risk taxonomy of composed of 22 risk categories across 5\nthematic areas: Strategic and Reputational, People, Operational, Political and Regulatory, and Macro / Economic. Within these thematic areas and risk categories, the impact\nof water and sustainability issues are embedded as either risk categories on their own, as key factors acting as multipliers, or as accelerators of existing business risk\ncategories.. In the consequence score, one of the 7 factors to provide input into the final score is Financial impact (as noted above). The thresholds to determine these inputs on financial\nimpact are: 1 (Insignificant) - less than 1% of Operating Income [OI]; 2 (Minor) - 2% of OI; 3 (Moderate) - 3% of OI; 4 (Major) - 4% of OI; 5 (Critical) - greater than 5% of OI.. An example of substantive impact considered in 2019 was in Pakistan. Due to groundwater depletion, the Chief Justice of Pakistan decided to impose a charge of Rs. 1 (USD\n0.85c) per extracted liter on beverage companies. The potential impact on The Coca-Cola Company was estimated to be approximately $28MM at that time. However,\nimportantly, the levy did not appear to be addressing the cause of the problem meaningfully. The Coca-Cola Company engaged stakeholders and government officials on 2\npoints: One was to expand the proposed levy, in order to ensure that a greater proportion of the overall water usage is covered, and therefore to ensure that the levy would\nhave a meaningful impact. Another point was to drive improvements by introducing  incentives for efficient water consumption. In early 2020, the Punjab Water Bill was\npassed, which authorized the creation of a Water Regulation and Development Authority to effectively manage and conserve water resources of the state Comment.

Company-specific description & strategy to realize opportunity\nThe Coca-Cola system uses about 300 billion liters of water across 800+ bottling facilities annually. To enhance our understanding of the impacts of climate change and\nwater-related impacts, we undertook a risk assessment, which has helped us to identify climate and water-related risks and opportunities. The risk that water-related\nregulations (e.g. changes in the price of water or restrictions on water supply) may impact our operations has been identified as a material risk, as a result of this work. In\naddition to procurement cost, water must undergo multiple additional treatment processes (RO, carbon, polishing, UV etc.), which create significant operating cost .\nTherefore, Water efficiency is strategic for our company because there is an opportunity and a financial incentive, to reduce water consumption and enhance water\nefficiency within our own operations. A fundamental pillar of our water stewardship work is managing the water use in our worldwide bottling plants. We are doing this by\ninvesting in water efficient technologies and by introducing new technologies which help to reduce our use of water. To realize this opportunity, we have a goal to reduce\nour water efficiency by 25 percent over 2010 levels by 2020. In 2019, our water efficiency improved for the 17th consecutive year, with a 2 percent improvement over 2018,\nand an improvement of more than 30 percent since 2004. We work in partnership with our bottling partners and business units globally to drive toward this goal, including\nmandatory tracking and reporting on progress on our internal KPI for this measure, which we refer to as \"Water-use ratio,\" which measures the the ratio of water used per\nlitre of product produced. One of our largest bottling partners, Coca-Cola European Partners, in 2018 \u20ac2.7 million was invested in water efficient technologies and\nprocesses, resulting in water savings of 75,170 m\u00b3. In 2018, at the Furstenfeldbruck manufacturing site in Germany an investment in water efficient bottle washers, saved\nup to 1,400 m3 of water per month. In Spain, our Barcelona site introduced a new system to reuse wastewater in 2018, which helped regenerate the ecosystem of a nearby\nlagoon and increased the biodiversity of aquatic flora and fauna..

Water-related issues receive direct oversight from The Public Policy and Sustainability Committee (PPSC) of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors because we believe that they\nhave the potential to have a meaningful financial impact on the company and thus are a part of the Board's fiduciary duty. The charter of the Public Policy and Sustainability\nCommittee (PPSC) states that as part of its authorities and responsibilities, the Committee will review the nature and scope of the Company\u2019s sustainability goals and the\nCompany's progress toward achieving those goals. In 2019, the Board held six meetings, and the PPSC held four meetings in 2019 (2020 Proxy, p.28). The following water-\nrelated issues were scheduled on the agenda for the PPSC\u2019s four meetings: An annual update on environmental trends specifically related to the Company\u2019s business, including\na discussion on water-related issues; ESG Investing. As part of the preparation for the Committee\u2019s meetings, updates on priority sustainability issues were provided every two\nmonths in 2019 from the Global Public Affairs, Communications and Sustainability function, including information on actions and progress toward the company's two global water\ntargets: By 2020, safely return to communities and nature an amount of water equal to what we use in our finished beverages and their production. By 2020, improve water\nefficiency in manufacturing operations by 25% compared with a 2010 baseline. In 2019 the PPSC also received presentations on water-related issues from the Chief Public\nAffairs, Communications and Sustainability Officer, the Director of Corporate Governance, and the Vice President for Environmental Sustainability and Social Impact. Review of\nwater-related issues was scheduled at one full-Board meeting in 2019 , however the full Board is provided with a report from the chair of the PPSC about all matters discussed\nduring each Committee meeting, so water related matters were raised at the full board during that time even if they were not part of the formal agenda. Discussions held at full\nboard meetings in 2019 included a discussion on water stewardship. During the board\u2019s regular sessions, they also hosted the CEO of one of our largest investors where a\nvariety of issues were discussed, including water.

Our long-term business planning and objectives have always been informed by a robust water strategy framework and risk assessment. Throughout 2019, a comprehensive\nreview of our global strategy has been conducted, with participation from all geographies, business units and key bottling partners, on a time horizon of 2030. In this long-term\nstrategy review, the following long-term water-related issues were considered: - Heightened Water-Stress - Deteriorating Water Quality - Potential Growth Limitations - Higher\nBusiness Demand for Water - Growing Exposure to Supply Chain Water Risks - Social License to operate - Regulation and Taxation Additionally, the following water-related issues\nthat we track on a short-to-medium term basis, were also reviewed: 1. Supply reliability, 2. Water efficiency, 3. Compliance, 4. Economics, 5. Water quality, 6. Local watershed, 7.\nSocial and Community. These short/medium and long-term water-related issues were reviewed with key stakeholders, such as investors, customers and consumers, suppliers,\nregulators and policy makers, and to confirm the water-related priorities for our operations, watersheds, and communities. The updated framework and priorities informs the\nongoing development of context-based, locally-relevant 2030 targets in operations, watersheds, and communities, to be set and defined in 2020 and 2021. These targets will\ninform our broader business objectives through global and local business planning processes.. Our financial planning processes across our global network are informed by our water strategy framework, which is built on a comprehensive assessment of our water risks. The\nstrategy underwent review in 2019 to update to a 2030 time horizon, by accounting for the following water-related issues: Short-to-mid term: 1. Supply reliability, 2. Water\nefficiency, 3. Compliance, 4. Water economics, 5. Water quality, 6. Local watershed, 7. Social and Community. Long-term: - Heightened Water-Stress - Deteriorating Water Quality\n- Potential Growth Limitations - Higher Business Demand for Water - Growing Exposure to Supply Chain Water Risks - Social License & Community - Regulation and Taxation\nTargets and goals for this strategy are currently set for 2020, and will be updated to 2030 goals across four strategic areas: - Operational performance - Watershed protection -\nCommunity action and awareness - Agricultural supply chains At the business unit level, implementation plans will be developed as part of annual long-term business planning\nprocess, which will then inform our financial planning processes. These plans are prepared by business units annually, based on progress toward targets, and implementation\nneeds. For example, plans to improve water efficiency and wastewater treatment at our sites may include assessment of investment costs, cost savings, reputational lift,\ncompliance and supply security factors.

Please explain\nWe report water-related CAPEX and OPEX for the US and India because within the markets with Coca-Cola Company owned operating facilities these are two priority\nmarkets for water risk mitigation. Overall our CAPEX in these priority markets increased 126.3% compared to the previous year mainly due to the construction of a major\nwater quality unit in the US and several large investments in India in surface water tanks and check dams. OPEX has remained steady with a slight decrease of 0.7%\ncompared to the previous year because while we closed several projects in the US in 2019, it was offset by 19 new water-related projects coming online in India. Water-\nrelated expenditure for CAPEX in 2019 was for water quality and waste water treatment systems, a chiller-condenser, surface water tanks and check dams. Water-related\nexpenditure for OPEX in 2019 was for the ongoing maintenance of these new systems and continued operations of similar projects constructed in previous years.. In 2018, building on our work with BSR in 2016/17 to create a framework for climate resilience at The Coca-Cola Company, we conducted a thorough climate-related risk priority assessment.

In a \"BAU\"\nworld, for which we used the IEA World Energy Outlook \"New Policies\" scenario, the\nfollowing are the top priority risks: - Changes to weather and precipitation patterns limiting\nthe availability of ingredients and raw materials: In the United States, we use corn-derived\nsweeteners. Impact on this agricultural supply chain will be felt through the variability in\nthe availability and stress of water resources, and will impact our ability to produce,\nresulting in a potential total financial exposure of USD1.88-4.55 billion, based on the\namount of revenue dependent on this commodity. - Water scarcity disrupting sourcing\nand/or production: In India, we have 10 facilities that are located in areas considered to\nbe either Extremely high or High in water stress. This means we have a total potential\nfinancial exposure of 811 - 964 million USD, based on the amount of revenue generated\nwithin those regions. In a \"2-Degree\" world, the following are considered the primary\nrisks, as well as some of the above risks, to a lesser degree, continuing to have impacts: -\nGHG and/or water regulations increasing COGS (GHG) or disrupting production (Water) -\nChanges to consumer perceptions affecting corporate reputation.

Quantitative metric\nOther, please specify (Replenish 100% of the water used in our finished beverages back to communities and nature). Description of target\nThis target is important to the Coca-Cola Company because nearly all of our products use water as a main ingredient, and water is critical to the communities in which we\noperate. As such, the quality of water at a basin and catchment level, if impacted, will have a detrimental impact on our ability to produce goods, or could adversely impact\nproduction costs, as well as impact our stakeholders and the communities in which we operate. Our company-wide target is to require 100% of our facilities, including all\nfacilities operated by franchise bottling partners, to implement strict standards to treat and return the water we use in our manufacturing process back to nature at a level\nthat supports aquatic life, covering 11 pollutants at a minimum, even when not required by local regulation. To meet this target, we require strict waste water quality\nassessment and reporting and invest in water treatment plants to ensure discharges meet criteria where infrastructure is not available..

Please explain\nOur measurement is the % of facilities, out of approximately 800 Coca-Cola system facilities, who meet the wastewater treatment criteria. Today, there are 4 facilities in\nareas of civil strife where we are currently unable to construct a wastewater treatment plant, 3 wastewater treatment plants that are under design and construction, and 2\nthat are in the planning phase. We are working with non-compliant plants to ensure they are able to align as local conditions allow and supporting their adoption of\nstandards and upgrades their systems require. Having only 9 non-compliant plants is a considerable win for our system and for the environment. In terms of wastewater\nvolume, 107 ML was fully treated and returned directly from our bottling plants, all over the world. In many places, our wastewater treatment was one of the first and\nsometimes still one of few in a given country. 55 . Description of goal\nIngredients are at the heart of our products, and our transformation into a total beverage company is also expanding the variety of ingredients we use. We source a wide\nrange of agricultural commodities\u2014including fruit juices, coffee, tea, sugar and soy, as well as special ingredients such as herbs and dairy-based ingredients\u2014 from a\ncomplex supply chain that spans the globe. Ensuring that these ingredients are produced in a way that respects farmworkers and communities and protects natural\nresources is a top priority for our company. Given that, for some of our products, 80% of the water usage originates in the agricultural supply chain, responsible and\nsustainable practice for water usage and management in the agricultural supply chain is a critically important for the sustainability of these ingredients. We set a company-\nwide goal to sustainably source all (100%) of our priority ingredients by 2020. Priority ingredients include cane and beet sugar, high fructose corn syrup, stevia, tea, coffee,\noranges, lemons, grapes, apples, mangos, pulp and paper fiber for packaging, palm oil and soy. The company is implementing this goal company-wide by asking all of our\nsuppliers of our priority ingredients to demonstrate they are meeting our Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles by using global sustainable agriculture standards and\nassurance schemes that are aligned with these such as the Bonsucro sustainable sugarcane standard and Rainforest Alliance certifications..

What standard and methodology was used?\nWe have a goal to require all of our plants to implement strict standards to treat and return the water we use in our manufacturing process back to nature at a level that\nsupports aquatic life, even when not required or requested by local governments and communities. To this end, our internal requirements promote effective and responsible\nwater use, treatment and disposal at a level that supports aquatic life. It is applied throughout the value chain to all Coca-Cola system locations globally. Our requirements\nmandate not only the items required for monitoring, but also the methods by which those items must be measured. Checks are conducted quarterly for compliance, in the\ncase of waste water, through external labs, and in the case of water volumetric measurements regarding usage and discharge of water, through entry into our internal data\nsystems and subsequent plausibility checks and annual data validation for sustainability reporting. Local validation of these requirements are done at a local level, including\nthe choice of third party and external reviewers. All water withdrawal data is globally reported and assured through the annual reporting process with an external party (EY). 47 . Across our global network, we have a long-term strategic framework 2010-2020, which was reviewed throughout 2019 to update to a time horizon of 2030. The water-related\nissues considered were as follows. Short-to-mid term: 1. Supply reliability, 2. Water efficiency, 3. Compliance, 4. Water economics, 5. Water quality, 6. Local watershed, 7. Social\nand Community. Long-term: - Heightened Water-Stress - Deteriorating Water Quality - Potential Growth Limitations - Higher Business Demand for Water - Growing Exposure to\nSupply Chain Water Risks - Social License to operate - Regulation and Taxation The resulting priorities break down into a strategy across the following areas: - Operational\nperformance (efficiency, reuse, stormwater management, and wastewater treatment) - Watershed protection / Sustainable communities through 100% water use replenishment -\nCommunity action and global awareness around water challenges/ Engagement on water policy - Integration of water resource management in our agricultural ingredient supply\nchain We currently have 2020 targets for each of these areas, which will be reassessed in 2020 and 2021 under a context-based lens, with a time horizon of 2030. Each business\nunit will then develop plans for achieving these targets over the long-term, as part of their annual business planning process. Plans will be implemented collectively by the relevant\nlocal business functions.. Company response to possible water-related outcomes. Comment. W7.3a. Approach to setting and monitoring targets and/or goals. We have identified areas of strategic importance to the company, in which we are positioned to make substantive impact: - Manufacturing facility performance (efficiency, reuse,\nstormwater management, and wastewater treatment) - Water resource management in our agricultural ingredient supply chain - Watershed health and replenishment - Community\nwater Access and Resilience - Raising global awareness and action around water challenges - Engagement on water policy In order to progress against these strategic areas, we\nhave 2 overarching 2020 goals for the global Coca-Cola System related to water. Replenish: By 2020, safely return to communities and nature an amount of water equal to what we\nuse in our finished beverages and their production. Efficiency: By 2020, improve water efficiency in manufacturing operations by 25% compared with a 2010 baseline. Wastewater:\n100% treatment of wastewater ensure in all facilities. We continue to monitor and report against these two metrics as a global system, as well as actively engage on all areas\nindicated above. In addition, within our supply chain, we set a goal to sustainably source our priority ingredients by 2020. Priority ingredients include cane and beet sugar, high\nfructose corn syrup, stevia, tea, coffee, oranges, lemons, grapes, apples, mangos, pulp and paper fiber for packaging, palm oil and soy. Finally, our goal to reduce the carbon\nfootprint of the \"Drink in Your Hand\" by 25% between 2010 and 2020 is another sustainability goal which is intricately linked to the impacts of water and vice versa. As these are\nCoca-Cola system-wide goals, they apply both to our direct Company-owned operations and our supply chain, which includes our franchise bottling partners and ingredients supply\nchain. Each business unit is responsible for working together with the local bottling partner to establish appropriate local goals, in line with global targets. Goal-setting, tracking and\nmonitoring is conducted through internal dashboards and monitoring calls and processes hosted by the sustainability governance function.. W8.1.

Please explain\nIn 2019, our water efficiency improved for the 17th consecutive year, an 18 percent improvement over 2010, and a 31 percent improvement since 2004. In 2004, we were\nusing 2.7 liters of water to make 1 liter of product. That means that 1 liter of water was in the product and another 1.7 liters was used in the manufacturing process, mostly\nfor keeping equipment clean. At the end of 2019, we were using 1.85 liters of water to make 1 liter of product, with the goal to reduce it to 1.7 liters of water by 2020.\nThrough improved water-use efficiency, system-wide we can save around US$1 billion (cumulative 2011 through 2020) in water acquisition, internal handling and discharge 54 . Please explain\nIn 2019, the Coca-Cola system (the Company and our bottling partners), continued to achieve our goal to replenish 100 percent of the water we use in our finished\nbeverages back to communities and nature by 2020. In 2019, we conducted 326 projects worldwide to restore watersheds and help replenish the equivalent amount of\nwater we withdraw from these watersheds into our products. As a result, we replenished 274 billion liters of water, which amounts to 161% of what we use in our finished\nbeverages and their production.. Level\nCompany-wide. Target year\n2020. Level\nCompany-wide. Start year\n1994. % of target achieved\n99. Progress\nThe measure by which we track and monitor our progress is through certification with third party platforms that are proven to comply with and promote the necessary\npractices to achieve our sustainability ambitions, as well as our Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles, a comprehensive set of principles to which all suppliers are\nrequired compliance. Therefore, the indicator to assess progress against this goal is the % of our sourcing that is certified to be sustainable, through our approved list of\ncertifications. We continue to work towards our goal of 100% of priority ingredients being certified as sustainable. In 2019 we sourced 69% of our beet sugar, 32% of our\ncane sugar, and 67% of our corn sustainably; 82 and 90% of our globally sourced tea and coffee, respectively, from sustainable sources. Some secondary indicators of the\nscale of the program are as follows: we are currently tracking SAGP compliance of 13 global priority ingredients, which represent about 80% of our total annual agricultural\ningredient purchases. In 2019, 54% of these ingredient volumes were SAGP-compliant (up from 8% in 2013, the beginning of the program). Challenges we have faced\ninclude regulated markets with little sustainability traction, social issues at the farm level, and limited knowledge of sustainability practice by and fragmentation of\nsmallholder farmers..

Water use ratio (efficiency) is defined as liters of water used (withdrawn) per liter of product produced. Total water used is the total of all water used by the Coca-Cola\nsystem in all global production facilities and co-located distribution centers, from all sources, including municipal, well, surface water, and collected rain water. This\nincludes water used for: production; water treatment; boiler makeup; cooling (contact and non-contact); cleaning and sanitation; backwashing filters; irrigation; washing\ntrucks and other vehicles; kitchen or canteen; toilets and sinks; and fire control. This does not include return water or non-branded bulk water donated to the community.\nLiters of product produced include all production, not just saleable. products. The intent of the replenish program is to develop a global portfolio of Community Water\nPartnership (CWP) projects that yield an annual volumetric water benefit equivalent to the company\u2019s annual global sales volume. Water replenish is defined as the ratio\nof water safely provided to communities and to nature by the community water partnership portfolio divided by sales volume of company beverage products as disclosed\nin the 2018 10-K (refer to Note B). This methodology takes into account that all wastewater from the processes is safely returned to the environment according to our\nstandards. Volumetric project benefits are quantified using TCCC\u2019s peer reviewed methodology as outlined in the Corporate Water Stewardship: Achieving a Sustainable\nBalance paper published in the Journal of Management and Sustainability in November 2013. Last year, we worked with a coalition of companies and partners to\nestablish an industry-wide approach to replenishment quantification, the Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting, which was published in September 2019.. \fW-FI.
