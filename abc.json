Select up to five.Agricultural\ncommoditiesPlease explainProduced\nand/or\nsourced% of\nrevenue\ndependent\non these\nagricultural\ncommoditiesSugar61-80SourcedIn addition to water, the principal raw materials used in our business are nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners. In the United States, for example, the principal nutritive\nsweetener is high fructose corn syrup (\u201cHFCS\u201d), which is nutritionally equivalent to sugar. The principal nutritive sweetener used by our business outside the United States\nis sucrose, i.e., refined sugar from sugar cane or beet. Our selection of \"sugar\" above represents a combination of both HFCS and sucrose as described here. The\nnutritive sweeteners used in the finished products are purchased, in some cases by The Company and in other cases by our independent bottling partners. This split of\nnutritive sweetener sourcing notwithstanding, 61-80% of our revenue is dependent upon this agricultural commodity. Through water footprinting studies across our value\nchain, we know that approximately 85% of the total water footprint of our products comes from our agricultural ingredient supply chain, particularly farming. We currently\nestimate the water footprint of cane sugar is 1700 l/kg; of corn 1200 l/kg and of beet sugar 920 l/kg; however, the impact of these footprints for sugar differs greatly\ndepending on levels of water-stress and of the presence of irrigation. A Global Enterprise Water Footprint Study, which is being currently undertaken, alongside additional\nrisk assessments to determine water stressed sourcing regions, will further inform our understanding of water impacts of sugar sourcing.21-40SourcedOther, please\nspecify\n(Orange)In 2019, juice from oranges (the largest volume of fruit we source by far) accounted for 21-40% of our revenue. Most of our orange juice is procured by a central\nprocurement team, sometimes together with our Coca-Cola bottling partners. Through water footprinting studies across our value chain, we know that approximately 85%\nof the total water footprint of our products comes from our agricultural ingredient supply chain, particularly farming. We estimate that the water footprint of oranges , is 560\nl/kg and most groves are irrigated. The impact of this footprint depends greatly on levels of water-stress.

During 2019, we continued to improve the\nefficiency of our water use. We now need only 1.85 liters of water per liter of final product, an 18% improvement compared to 2010. We achieved this through\ninvestments in technologies which enable greater reuse and recycling as well as increased efficiency, such as: - Industry approved water-efficient technologies in our\nlines to reduce water use in rinsing of our packages. - Replacing the nozzle types used for cleaning operations with a rotary type. - Switching our lines/conveyors to\nuse dry lubricants where possible to avoid water usage in conveyors - Reverse osmosis which allow us to reuse the water for many beneficial uses. So while our\nsales volume increased from 29.6 billion unit cases in 2018 to 30.3 billion our total water withdrawals decreased. At the same time, we have increased water reuse\nand are working on new, transparent metrics for water use going forward.

The assessment includes baseline water stress, projected water stress\nto 2030, water quality challenges and access to water and sanitation (WASH) challenges, for direct operations and key agricultural commodities. For\nthe purpose of this report, we will disclose data for the 135 company-owned facilities in 2019. Of these facilities, we identified 24 facilities (for full\ndetails see W4.1b and W5.1) to be located in areas of \"High\" or \"Extremely High\" baseline water stress. We have expanded our definition of \"water\nstressed areas\" from last year to include both High and Extremely high water stress. Baseline water stress is an indicator of competition for water\nresources and is defined informally as the ratio of demand for water by human society divided by available water. It is also commonly known as the\nwithdrawals-to-availability ratio. Baseline water stress measures the ratio of total annual water withdrawals, from industry, domestic and agricultural\nusers, to average annual available renewable supplies. WRI used a long time series of supply (1950\u20132010) to reduce the effect of multi-year climate\ncycles and to allow us to ignore complexities of short-term water storage (e.g. dams, floodplains) for which global operational data is non-existent.\nBaseline water stress thus measures chronic water stress rather than drought stress, and does not include the effects of deep groundwater, water\ngovernance or infrastructure in meeting industrial, domestic and agricultural demands for water. The risk thresholds used are below, and are according\nto the scoring methodology employed by WRI's Aqueduct tool: 0-1 Low (<10%) 1-2 Low -Medium (10-20%) 2-3 Medium -High(20-40%) 3-4 High (40-\n80%) 4-5 Extremely High (>80%) In 2019, 2.6% of company-owned facilities' total water withdrawals were from areas with a High or Extremely High\nbaseline water stress.(W-FB1.2e) For each commodity reported in question W-FB1.1a, do you know the proportion that is produced/sourced from areas with water stress?W-FB1.2eAgricultural\ncommoditiesPlease explainThe\nproportion\nof this\ncommodity\nproduced in\nareas with\nwater\nstress is\nknownThe\nproportion\nof this\ncommodity\nsourced\nfrom areas\nwith water\nstress is\nknownSugarNot\napplicableYesNot\napplicableYesOther\ncommodities\nfrom W-\nFB1.1a,\nplease\nspecify\n(Orange)In 2018/2019 we conducted a global enterprise water risk assessment, using WRI Aqueduct, covering all of the Coca-Cola Systems production facilities globally and 9 of\nour priority commodities and their sourcing regions.

It is therefore essential that we collect\ndata on water use, risks and management information from suppliers of these commodities in order to inform our supplier evaluation process and decision-making . Our\ncollection of supplier water information data is focused primarily on suppliers of sugar and oranges as these commodities constitute the largest water use in our supply\nchain. In 2019 we requested that 39 of our most critical ingredient suppliers complete CDP's water questionnaire and specific supplier survey. Suppliers are incentivized to\nrespond as we make it clear that the data captured by the CDP supply chain water questionnaire informs our supplier \"Balanced scorecards\".Impact of the engagement and measures of success\nThe information requested from suppliers includes total annual water withdrawals, total annual water discharge and total annual water consumption. 67% of requested\ningredient suppliers responded to the CDP water questionnaire in 2019, and a total of 57% of all requested suppliers responded. Our target response rate from suppliers is\n100%. We also saw that for suppliers that responded to the question of how water withdrawals compared to the previous year, 69% responded that withdrawals were lower\nor about the same.

      "value": "(W-FB3.1) How does your organization identify and classify potential water pollutants associated with its food, beverage, and tobacco sector activities that could\nhave a detrimental impact on water ecosystems or human health?The Coca-Cola Company has strict requirements for influent and effluent water quality at our facilities, as well as those at our bottling partners, and we require strict\nadherence to these standards, or local regulatory standards, whichever standard is more stringent. We have a goal to require all plants to meet strict standards to treat and\nreturn the water we use in our manufacturing process back to nature at a level that supports aquatic life, even when not required or requested by local governments and\ncommunities. To this end, our internal requirements promote effective and responsible water use, treatment and disposal at a level that supports aquatic life. It is applied\nthroughout the value chain to all facilities globally with the potential to generate wastewater or affect stormwater. The internal requirements cover 11 pollutants as mandatory\nin all facilities across the globe. If there are any legal requirements in the given geographical region to monitor additional pollutants not covered within these 11 pollutants,\nthese would be added to the list of mandatory pollutants to monitor. In addition, business units are required to assess and monitor an additional list of 9 pollutants, considering specific local circumstances. This assessment is conducted\nthrough what internally is called a Facility Water Vulnerability Assessments, which assesses risk across 72 potential vulnerabilities, across 20 risk categories. Of the\nvulnerabilities, at least 20 are directly or indirectly related to identifying and classifying potential water pollutants. The framework and approach is aligned with the Alliance for\nWater Stewardship Standard.The risk categories relevant to water quality / pollutants include:- Source Water Availability (Quality)- Waste Water Compliance- Water Quality Compliance- Water Quality Deterioration and Fluctuation- Ineffective Treatment of Water- Watershed Vulnerability- Impact of Regulations on Watersheds and Water QualityAcceptability limits are set for discharges directly to the environment following secondary treatment of the wastewater on-site.  If we are discharging to a utility for further\ntreatment, our facilities ensure that we also meet the pre-treatment requirements of such utilities, and the ultimate discharge of the final effluent from those utilities may have\ndifferent discharge limits based on local regulations. Additionally, recommended methods listed below are required for our quarterly compliance checks performed by external\nlabs. However, there may be other analytical methods that would be more appropriate at the facility level for more routine daily and weekly verification.Below are a few of the pollutants whose monitoring is mandatory across all facilities:- Fecal coliform, via stormwater or improper treatment of wastewater. Required method of measurement: 9221E. - Ammonia, Phosphorus, via storm-water, or improper treatment of wastewater. Required method of measurement: 4500 - NH3, 4500 - P- Total Suspended Solids, via improper treatment of wastewater or stormwater. Required method of measurement: 2540D- BOD5, via improper treatment of wastewater or stormwater.  Required method of measurement: 5210BOur approach and policies do not vary and are consistent across the value chain. In our value chain we work with our suppliers and supply chains. Our Supplier Guiding\nPrinciples (SGPs) and Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGPs) set out the requirements The Coca-Cola Company expects all of our suppliers to comply with,\nincluding requirements on water management (including pollutants), and minimizing water quality impacts from wastewater discharges and erosion, and nutrient/agrochemical\nrunoff.  We work together with and approve certification schemes such as Bonsucro, SAI and others for sustainable ingredient sourcing, all of which include extensive water\nmanagement requirements, including water pollutant management, from measuring abstractions, implementing water efficient irrigation technologies and managing run-off.   The impacts of these pollutants are on nearby water bodies and watersheds, affecting entire local ecosystems and all water users, including our own bottling facilities as we\ndraw from these watersheds. In our supply chain, our agricultural suppliers could experience detrimental impacts to their own crop yields and impact water users in their\nsurrounding communities, as well as ecosystems, if pollutants are not managed correctly. Some pollutants may impact surface and ground water quality. Fertilizers and other\npollutants could cause a potential change in pH, increase the amount of eutrophication in the water, or depending on the type, cause algae or other microorganisms to grow\nin excess. This could result in impacts on aquatic and natural life across ecosystems and enter watersheds, affecting local fauna as well as broader ecosystems and human\nhealth, as well as potentially disrupting various uses of water, including industrial uses, if untreated.W-FB3.1aCDPPage 13 of 58\f"

We require strict waste water\nquality assessment and reporting and invest in water treatment plants to ensure discharges meet criteria where infrastructure is not available.Description of water pollutant and potential impacts\nFertilizer is used in our supply chain to grow agricultural commodities such as sugar beet and cane sugar, coffee, tea, juices, and others. Potential pollutants impacting\nwater quality include ammonia and nitrates, two of the key pollutants outlined in The Coca-Cola Company's internal Requirements in 2015. As identified in The Coca-Cola\nCompany Water footprint sustainability assessment (WFSA), potential impacts are that nitrate and ammonia from fertilizer entering groundwater as a consequence of\nnitrate leaching from fields into the groundwater where crops are grown. Fertilizer could also pollute via stormwater, or due to improper treatment of wastewater, impacting\nnearby water bodies and watersheds, affecting entire local ecosystems and all water users. Ammonia discharges from sugar plants may also impact surface and ground\nwater quality. Our current data on water pollution risks from agriculture (e.g. the grey water component of the water footprint I sugar beet or oranges) does not show a\nsignificant risk of fertiliser run-off. However, a new enterprise water footprint assessment will provide further granularity of data across the value chain in 2020.Potential water pollutant\nFertilizersActivity/value chain stage\nAgriculture \u2013 supply chainManagement procedures\nSoil conservation practices\nCrop management practices\nSustainable irrigation and drainage management\nFertilizer management\nWaste water management\nFollow regulation standardsPlease explain\nOur Supplier Guiding Principles (SGPs) and Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGPs) set out the requirements The Coca-Cola Company expects all of our\nsuppliers to comply with, including requirements on water management (including pollutants), and minimizing water quality impacts from wastewater discharges and\nerosion, and nutrient/agrochemical runoff.

Not only do nearly all of our products contain water as the most critical main ingredient, but water is also essential to growing the agricultural\ningredients and producing the packaging and other essential materials that are critical in producing and delivering our products to market. Adverse impacts on water availability or\nquality in our supply chains could have significant implications in our capability to produce or the cost of our product and therefore the profitability and growth potential of the business.\nThe tools used to assess the implications of water to our key commodities and raw materials are WRI Aqueduct, balanced scorecards with our suppliers, and our internal tracking of\ncompliance to our Supplier Agricultural Guiding Principles. First, using WRI Aqueduct, we make a global assessment of the sourcing regions of our agricultural commodities that we\npurchase, and the water stress or scarcity of those geographies in order to map and prioritize our efforts. In parallel, we engage with suppliers through our procurement function, in\nwhich suppliers are assessed through balanced scorecards, which score suppliers on areas including quality, safety, environmental management and sustainability. A key feature of\nsupplier engagement is a requirement for all suppliers to adhere to our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGPs), and all agricultural ingredient suppliers to comply with our Sustainable\nAgriculture Guiding Principles (SAGPs), which set out compliance requirements for all suppliers, including requirements on water management, and minimizing water quality impacts\nfrom wastewater discharges and erosion, and nutrient/agrochemical runoff. Suppliers demonstrate SAGP compliance primarily by receiving certification from sustainable ingredient\nsourcing certification schemes with whom we work together or support. These sustainable agriculture standards and assurance schemes all include extensive water management\nrequirements, including water pollutant management, from measuring abstractions, implementing water efficient irrigation technologies and managing run-off. The Farm Sustainability\nAssessment of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform, the Bonsucro sustainable sugarcane standard and Rainforest Alliance certifications are some of the leading standards\nwe support. Suppliers are audited on their compliance with these principles on a yearly basis.In all geographies and areas in which we operate, the use of water is impacted by local regulations and regulatory frameworks. Without effective governance and regulations,\nsustainable water use in some cases could come under risk. Additionally, effective regulation could unlock many opportunities and benefits for both the local communities and\nbusiness, potentially impacting community well-being, business productivity and levels of cost and capacity. We conduct global, plant-level water risk assessments to inform our global\nwater strategy on an approximate triennial frequency, across a 10-year risk horizon, which is then reviewed and updated annually. The process involves a detailed, plant-level survey\nfor each facility, extensive geospatial monitoring of various factors affecting water and a risk quantification model.

We then conduct a\ndetailed site-level survey using the Facility Water Vulnerability Assessment tool that covers 72 potential vulnerabilities, spread across 20 risk categories for every site, including\nassessment of risk related to water-related regulatory frameworks. Regulation is a critical topic, for which 20 relevant vulnerabilities are considered across the following risk categories:\nInfrastructure, Water Supply Policy, Water Efficiency Practices, Waste Water Compliance, Water Quality Compliance, Water Cost, Regulations, Access to Safe Water and\nGovernment Interactions. Our standards require that all production facilities form and train a comprehensive water resource management team, work with expert(s) to complete a\nsource vulnerability assessment (SVA) that inventories risks specific to the water source, prepare a source water protection plan (SWPP) with actions, roles, responsibilities and\nfunding needs, and execute the plan, and to review the plan and progress annually. For example, in Europe, the business recently led the creation of a business coalition in support of\nthe EU Water Framework Directive and is actively engaging with policy makers for preserving a strong regulatory approach to water.The status of ecosystems and habitats in our areas of operation or in our supply chain are essential in ensuring the long-term sustainability and availability of water.

In our updated strategy, the health of ecosystems and habitats will be further integrated into our\naction plans to support watershed health, which will be guided by a watershed health scorecard, including ecosystem and habitat aspects.Ensuring all facilities provide fully-functioning, safely managed WASH services for all employees is fundamental to the health, safety and well-being of our employees. Requirements\nto this effect are included in our global standard operating procedures (KORE). As a food & beverage business, ensuring advanced WASH practices in all Coca-Cola system facilities\nis critical for product integrity and we monitor for 100% compliance with our internal operating requirements, which includes a full compliance requirement on basic food-safety\nstandards such as PD ISO/TS 22002-1, Prerequisite Programs on Food Safety, and FSSC 22000.

This moment led us to examine and better understand water risks to our company and the communities in which we operate, looking well beyond the four walls of our\nfacilities and into our supply chain. It also led to our pioneering goal, established 10 years ago, to replenish the water we used in the production of our beverages. At the time, the goal\nwas a leap of faith. But we met and exceeded it, and other companies have followed suit. We continue to meet and exceed the target each year since 2015 when we first met the\ntarget. As we transition into the next decade of our water strategy, we recognize that it is important to continue performing against the targets that we set for ourselves, as this\ncontinues to form part of our license to operate. We will make water replenishment a contributing factor of achieving overall watershed health and focus action on the most water\nstressed regions.(W3.3c) Which of the following stakeholders are considered in your organization\u2019s water-related risk assessments?W3.3cCustomersPlease explainRelevance\n&\ninclusionRelevant,\nalways\nincludedEmployeesRelevant,\nalways\nincludedWe are a business-to-business company. Our finished products are sold to customers, which can be very large to very small retailers (grocery stores), restaurants, hotels, catering\ncompanies, leisure and entertainment parks etc. As a result, customers' voices and requirements are vital in considering our water-related policies, risks and strategies. The following\nare examples of our methods of engagement with customers in water-related risk assessments and relevant examples: - As significant water users in their own operations: for\nexample, Hotels and catering businesses tend to use a lot of water and we have engaged with a number of our leading customers (e.g. Hilton Group) in the US and Europe to help\nthem understand their water risks, share our approaches and advise on water efficiency. - As major indirect users of water through their supply chains, agricultural produce is a major\nwater user for many of our retail customers, e.g. in their fresh produce supply chain. We seek to engage customers on sustainable agriculture where we have common supply chains,\nfor example on fruit (for fresh and juice). For example, in Spain (Huelva region), we helped bring together retail customers like Migros and M&S to work with us and our suppliers on\nwater-efficient strawberry farming. - As a major touchpoint for awareness raising on water with consumers: Retailers are the touchpoint of our brands with the consumers. We engage\ncustomers to partner on the Point of Sales to raise awareness on water with our consumers. For example, we supported Metro Group in a multi-country consumer activation on world\nwater day to raise awareness and funds for water projects in India.Employee engagement is critical for the success of our business and the achievement of water goals. We engage our employees across the system to embed our business objectives\nin the day-to-day way of doing business, especially as we have such a vast operational footprint. Also, employee engagement surveys show how important our work on sustainability,\nincluding water, is for employee loyalty and engagement. Our method of engagement is as follows: We inform and engage employees on water in different ways, through our intranet\n(Connect) or corporate website, internal newsletters (company and bottlers), specific communications on major water events like World Water Day, Global Water Summit and\nStockholm Water Week. Depending on what works best on local level, we also take employees on community days to water projects and field visits to support our partners and raise\nawareness. environmental awards for our bottlers include water performance and reward best in class and best performer bottlers. As a food & beverage business, ensuring\nadvanced WASH practices in all Coca-Cola system facilities is critical for product integrity and we monitor for 100% compliance with our internal operating requirements, which\nincludes a full compliance requirement on basic food-safety standards such as PD ISO/TS 22002-1, Prerequisite Programs on Food Safety, and FSSC 22000.CDPPage 17 of 58\f"

As such, these local water utilities are key stakeholders, and at the local level across our global system, our\noperational entities engage with them on an ongoing basis. Each bottling facility is required to conduct a site-level survey using the internal, proprietary Facility Water Vulnerability\nAssessment tool that covers 72 potential vulnerabilities, spread across 20 risk categories for every site, including assessment of risk related to local water utilities and evaluating\npublic sector local and regional water resource medium and long-term planning. Based on the findings of each local bottling facility, our internal global standards require that all\nproduction facilities form and train a comprehensive water resource management team, work with expert(s) to complete a source vulnerability assessment (SVA) that inventories these\nrisks, prepare a source water protection plan (SWPP) with actions, roles, responsibilities and funding needs, and execute the plan, and to review the plan and progress annually. Our\nmethod for engagement with local water utilities is through sharing knowledge and best practice. In several regions, for example in sub-saharan Africa, the local water utilies have\nmajor capability challenges , especially around leakage management, non-revenue water, waste water treatment etc. Our bottling partners (e.g. CCBA, CCHBC) work with the local\nregulators and utilities to share knowledge and best practice. In Capetown, our local bottler Coca-Cola Peninsula Beverages worked actively with the local utility on developing an\nalternative water supply strategy and to reduce supply pressure on the municipal provider. As part of our access to water program, the RAIN (Replenish Africa Initiative) is supporting\nwork led by WSUP (Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor, for example in Madagascar, to strengthen the utility of the capital and enable it to expand services to 480.000\nunderserved people.Other\nstakeholder,\nplease specifyRelevant,\nalways\nincludedOur source water protection program requires that each facility, as part of their source water vulnerability assessment, evaluate public sector local and regional water resource master\nand long-term planning. Such assessments are required to be maintained and updated on five-year intervals, or sooner, as conditions warrant. As an when additional stakeholders are\nidentified as relevant at a local level, they are always included in the assessment of risk and opportunity for the relevant plant or local entity.W3.3d(W3.3d) Describe your organization\u2019s process for identifying, assessing, and responding to water-related risks within your direct operations and other stages of\nyour value chain.In our operations, we have a 4-step process for identifying, assessing and responding to water-related risk. Step 1 is a global enterprise water risk assessment, using WRI Aqueduct, covering all production facilities globally. The work assesses baseline water stress, projected water\nstress to 2030, water quality challenges and access to water and sanitation (WASH) challenges, for direct operations and key agricultural commodities. Step 2 is to overlay relevant data points such as population data and urbanization rates and to understand and prioritize our work.  Our latest such work is the basis of our\ndisclosure in this response, for facilities and ingredient sourcing regions located in areas of water stress. It is repeated on a triennial basis, or as conditions warrant. Step 3 is to collect plant-level feedback of potential risks in a Facility Water Vulnerability Assessment. The assessment covers 72 potential vulnerabilities across 20 risk\ncategories, completed by our local teams in every geography of operation, the assessment splits into the following six thematic areas:  1. Supply reliability, 2. Water\nefficiency, 3. Water Economics, 4. Product Quality and Safety 5.  Watershed sustainability, 6. Local / Social Issues.Step 4 is to apply our global standards on water resource sustainability, which, based on findings from the assessments above, require all production facilities to: 1. Form a\nwater resource management team; 2. With expert(s), complete a Source Vulnerability Assessment (SVA) to inventory and fully assess all identified risks; 3. Prepare a Source\nWater Protection Plan (SWPP) with actions, roles, responsibilities and funding needs; 4. Implement the SWPP; and 5. Review the SVA and SWPP annually. The outcomes have informed decision-making as per below:The categorization of water stress-levels resulting from Steps 1 and 2 (WRI Aqueduct water-risk mapping and further prioritization by data overlays) have allowed the\nbusiness to segment our global facility locations in order of priority, creating the foundation for our business to explore context-based water targets, based on the requirements\nof each local context.  Additionally, the local assessments in Steps 3 and 4, following from the water-risk mapping, provide an indication of where and what kinds of projects\nthe business should invest in locally, in order to help regenerate watersheds and replenish the water that we use in our operations. For example, much of India faces high to\nextremely high water stress, according to WRI, and TCCC has 9 owned bottling facilities in the country located in such areas. Taking these outcomes and identifying the\nspecific, local needs for protecting source water and managing vulnerabilities, the local team has identified a multitude of ongoing initiatives and projects. As one example,\ncapturing seasonal monsoon rains, for example through the construction of check dams and rainwater harvesting structures, is critical in rural area to address flooding and\nquality impacts of stormwater. Since 2009, The Coca-Cola India Foundation has created more than 13 billion liters of water replenishment potential through 150 community\nwater conservation projects, impacting over 600,000 lives across 500+ villages in remote and water-stressed areas across India.In our value chain, we assess the implications of water risk to our key commodities and raw materials first using WRI Aqueduct. We make a global assessment of the sourcing\nregions of our agricultural commodities that we purchase, and the water stress levels of those geographies in order to map and prioritize our efforts. In addition, we apply\nseveral criteria such as spend, strategic importance, and sustainability risk to prioritize the ingredients we track. We are currently tracking 13 global priority ingredients\nrepresenting about 80% of our total annual agricultural ingredient purchases.As our method of engagement, we require all agricultural suppliers to adhere to our Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGPs), which set out compliance\nrequirements for all suppliers, including requirements on water management, and minimizing water quality impacts from wastewater discharges and erosion, and\nnutrient/agrochemical runoff.  Suppliers demonstrate SAGP compliance primarily by receiving certification from sustainable ingredient sourcing certification schemes with\nwhom we work together or support. These sustainable agriculture standards and assurance schemes all include extensive water management requirements. The Farm\nSustainability Assessment of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform, the Bonsucro sustainable sugarcane standard and Rainforest Alliance certifications are some of\nthe leading standards we support. Suppliers are audited on their compliance with these principles on a yearly basis. Of our 13 global priority ingredients, in 2019, 54% of\nthese ingredient volumes were SAGP-compliant (up from 8% in 2013, the beginning of the program).CDPPage 19 of 58\f"

Our business uses a significant volume of corn-derived\nsweetener, high fructose corn syrup, as a sweetener in our beverages in many of key markets, including the United States of America. If the production of corn is impacted,\na significant portion of our product portfolio in this market will be directly impacted, through cost and availability impacts of a key ingredient. Roughly 29% of of our global\nportfolio is now low or no-calories. The remainder of that portfolio uses either sugar or corn-derived sweetener. Specifically, in the United States, these products use corn-\nderived sweeteners, nearly all grown in the United States. Based on our climate-related priority risk assessment, we understand that the chronic physical impacts of climate\nchange, namely changes in precipitation patterns, temperature variability and changes in weather patterns, are expected to have a significant impact on our agricultural\nsupply chains, which will be felt through the variability in the availability and stress of water resources. Through product water footprinting exercises, we also have\nascertained that for some of our products, 80% of our water use sits within the agricultural supply chain, making this portion of our water usage particularly significant. As a\nresult of these assessments, we understand that if the production of corn is impacted in the United States, a significant portion of our product portfolio in the US will be\ndirectly impacted, potentially increasing cost and creating challenges on the availability of sourcing for a key ingredient. We therefore consider the water-related risks in the\ngrowing (i.e. sourcing) of this raw material to be a critical risk to monitor and understand.Timeframe\n4-6 yearsLikelihood\nLikelyMagnitude of potential impact\nHighAre you able to provide a potential financial impact figure?\nYes, an estimated rangePotential financial impact figure (currency)\n<Not Applicable>Potential financial impact figure - minimum (currency)\n1580000000Potential financial impact figure - maximum (currency)\n4552000000Explanation of financial impact\nThis is the amount of current revenue that is dependent specifically on corn sourced from the United States, which is the scope of this risk calculation. Assumptions below: -\nNet operating revenue (public data) for North America Operating Group is used as an input. - USA revenue breaks down proportional to its UC volume share within the NA\nOG. - Global percentage of low or no-calorie beverages in our portfolio (29%) is applicable as an average to the USA market. - Low end of range = exposed to risk only in\nlocations of extremely high water stress. - High end of range = exposed to risk in locations of both high and extremely high water stress. Estimated exposure was calculated\nby taking North America Operating Group revenue, multiplying the volume share of USA, and further applying % of portfolio that use corn-derived sweetener, based on\nassumption above. We then multiply the % of our corn that we believe may be exposed to risk due to water stress based on climate change impacts.Primary response to riskSupplier engagementOther, please specify (Drive the adoption of sustainable sourcing certification by suppliers as a way of improving the resilience of our agricultural supply chains, )Description of response\nIn 2013, we set a goal to more sustainably source our priority ingredients by 2020. Corn is one of our priority ingredients, in the form of High Fructose Corn Syrup. We\nrequire that our suppliers meet our 15 Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGP), which establish the framework for progress and are integrated into governance\nprocurement processes. As a case study specifically on corn, we advance our sustainable sourcing through membership in Field to Market: The Alliance for Sustainable\nAgriculture, through which we work on more sustainable corn production in the United States. With our four biggest corn suppliers, we are aiming to fulfill a 2014\ncommitment to expand the application of Field to Market\u2019s Fieldprint\u00ae Platform, a data-driven tool that quantifies water use, energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and\nother measures of sustainability performance. The target is to engage corn farmers representing 1 million acres by 2020, which would position The Coca-Cola Company\nwith 100% more sustainable corn production in the U.S. market. As a result of such work, our global % of corn sourced from sustainable sources has moved into the 51 -\n75% range, up from 0 - 25% in 2016 and 2017.Cost of response\n100000Explanation of cost of response\nThe cost of response to this risk is the total annual contribution from The Coca-Cola Company's to select platforms such as Field to Market, or the SAI platform to promote\nthe advancement of sustainable sourcing and raise awareness at a global level.CDPPage 25 of 58\f"

To enhance our understanding of the impacts of climate change and\nwater-related impacts, we undertook a risk assessment, which has helped us to identify climate and water-related risks and opportunities. The risk that water-related\nregulations (e.g. changes in the price of water or restrictions on water supply) may impact our operations has been identified as a material risk, as a result of this work. In\naddition to procurement cost, water must undergo multiple additional treatment processes (RO, carbon, polishing, UV etc.), which create significant operating cost .\nTherefore, Water efficiency is strategic for our company because there is an opportunity and a financial incentive, to reduce water consumption and enhance water\nefficiency within our own operations. A fundamental pillar of our water stewardship work is managing the water use in our worldwide bottling plants. We are doing this by\ninvesting in water efficient technologies and by introducing new technologies which help to reduce our use of water. To realize this opportunity, we have a goal to reduce\nour water efficiency by 25 percent over 2010 levels by 2020. In 2019, our water efficiency improved for the 17th consecutive year, with a 2 percent improvement over 2018,\nand an improvement of more than 30 percent since 2004. We work in partnership with our bottling partners and business units globally to drive toward this goal, including\nmandatory tracking and reporting on progress on our internal KPI for this measure, which we refer to as \"Water-use ratio,\" which measures the the ratio of water used per\nlitre of product produced.

The\nassessment was conducted in partnership with DNV GL and Coca-Cola European Partners and was conducted in alignment with the recommendations of the Taskforce for Climate-related\nFinancial Disclosures. It assessed Acute physical, Chronic physical and Transitional risks across a 10-year timescale, through a host of internal and external information and interviews, and\nidentified both a BAU and 2 degree scenario for scenario analysis.(W7.3a) Has your organization identified any water-related outcomes from your climate-related scenario analysis?\nYes(W7.3b) What water-related outcomes were identified from the use of climate-related scenario analysis, and what was your organization\u2019s response?Description of possible water-related outcomesCompany response to possible water-related outcomesThe identified priority water-related risks are split between the two scenarios. In a \"BAU\"\nworld, for which we used the IEA World Energy Outlook \"New Policies\" scenario, the\nfollowing are the top priority risks: - Changes to weather and precipitation patterns limiting\nthe availability of ingredients and raw materials: In the United States, we use corn-derived\nsweeteners. Impact on this agricultural supply chain will be felt through the variability in\nthe availability and stress of water resources, and will impact our ability to produce,\nresulting in a potential total financial exposure of USD1.88-4.55 billion, based on the\namount of revenue dependent on this commodity. - Water scarcity disrupting sourcing\nand/or production: In India, we have 10 facilities that are located in areas considered to\nbe either Extremely high or High in water stress. This means we have a total potential\nfinancial exposure of 811 - 964 million USD, based on the amount of revenue generated\nwithin those regions. In a \"2-Degree\" world, the following are considered the primary\nrisks, as well as some of the above risks, to a lesser degree, continuing to have impacts: -\nGHG and/or water regulations increasing COGS (GHG) or disrupting production (Water) -\nChanges to consumer perceptions affecting corporate reputationThroughout 2019, a comprehensive review of our global strategy was conducted, with participation from\nall geographies, business units and key bottling partners, on a time horizon of 2030. In this long-term\nstrategy review, the following long-term water-related issues were considered: - Heightened Water-\nStress - Deteriorating Water Quality - Potential Growth Limitations - Higher Business Demand for Water -\nGrowing Exposure to Supply Chain Water Risks - Social License to operate - Regulation and Taxation\nThe water-related outcomes of our climate-related scenario analysis were integrated into the review of\nour global strategy framework. As a result, a strong link between the impacts of climate change and\nwater-related outcomes has been drawn, and our management of the water-related outcomes of climate\nchange features as a key component of our global water sustainability strategy. Specifically, this means\nthat our global water risk assessments, our Facility Water Vulnerability Assessment, and Source\nVulnerability Assessments, which are the key components of our updated global water sustainability\nstrategy, will feature climate change impacts as a core element against which to assess our risks. This\nupdated strategy will roll out in 2021, and all assessments and targets will be set on a 2030 timeline.\nBased on our facility and geography-specific risk assessments, our updated strategy will feature\ncontext-specific targets, tying in the various long-term impacts above.W7.3CommentUse of\nclimate-\nrelated\nscenario\nanalysisYesRow\n1W7.3aW7.3bRow\n1Climate-\nrelated\nscenarios\nand\nmodels\nappliedOther,\nplease\nspecify\n(IEA WEO\nNew\nPolicies\nScenario,\nREMIND\nIAM 2C\nScenario)W7.4CDPPage 53 of 58\f"

Total water used is the total of all water used by the Coca-Cola\nsystem in all global production facilities and co-located distribution centers, from all sources, including municipal, well, surface water, and collected rain water. This\nincludes water used for: production; water treatment; boiler makeup; cooling (contact and non-contact); cleaning and sanitation; backwashing filters; irrigation; washing\ntrucks and other vehicles; kitchen or canteen; toilets and sinks; and fire control. This does not include return water or non-branded bulk water donated to the community.\nLiters of product produced include all production, not just saleable. products. The intent of the replenish program is to develop a global portfolio of Community Water\nPartnership (CWP) projects that yield an annual volumetric water benefit equivalent to the company\u2019s annual global sales volume. Water replenish is defined as the ratio\nof water safely provided to communities and to nature by the community water partnership portfolio divided by sales volume of company beverage products as disclosed\nin the 2018 10-K (refer to Note B). This methodology takes into account that all wastewater from the processes is safely returned to the environment according to our\nstandards. Volumetric project benefits are quantified using TCCC\u2019s peer reviewed methodology as outlined in the Corporate Water Stewardship: Achieving a Sustainable\nBalance paper published in the Journal of Management and Sustainability in November 2013. Last year, we worked with a coalition of companies and partners to\nestablish an industry-wide approach to replenishment quantification, the Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting, which was published in September 2019.W10.

Indirect Use: Good quality water is vital to ensuring a sustainable supply of the agricultural ingredients,\npackaging, and other key materials we use in our products. Through water footprinting studies across our value chain, we know that approximately 85% of the total water\nfootprint of our products comes from our agricultural ingredient supply chain. We also recognize that access to safe water for drinking and sanitation is essential to the\ncommunities where we operate and across our value chain. Our plans to diversify our portfolio and increase volumes in products such as tea, coffee, dairy, fruit and nuts will\nlikely increase our future water dependency in indirect usage, as these ingredients are often highly water intensive. Through our water replenish projects with farmers to\nimprove productive use of water and our sustainable agriculture program, we will continue to work with our agriculture supply chain to improve water management practices\nand water efficiency.Direct use: Our direct use of re-used/recycled water is limited to non-product activities, such as cleaning-in-place processes and water treatment operations, and we directly\nsource very little brackish and/or produced water. Therefore, the direct use importance rating of recycled, brackish and/or produced water is neutral. For recycling processes,\nmany of our facilities across the system have implemented water recovery systems meeting the highest quality standards, and where applicable expanding the use of such\nwater sources, helping minimize our environmental impacts. Future water dependency of this type of water is expected to increase moderately given our ambition to increase\nregenerative water use as part of our 2030 water strategy that is currently being finalized. Indirect use: Recycled, brackish or other types of water can be treated and used in\nour agricultural supply chains, including for irrigation purposes. Continued access to sufficient amounts of such water is important to help to reduce freshwater extraction,\nreducing the impact on water tables, and improving local water availability. This is particularly critical in water stressed areas where we source our ingredients. As we continue\nto grow our business, diversify our portfolio and increase our sourcing volumes in products such as tea, coffee, dairy and fruit we expect that our future water dependency on\nthis type of water will increase in our agricultural supply chains. In addition, several of our major sourcing regions are expected to undergo increasing water stress due to the\nimpacts of climate change which will further decrease the amount of available freshwater and increase our reliance on recycled water.

Select up to five.Agricultural\ncommoditiesPlease explainProduced\nand/or\nsourced% of\nrevenue\ndependent\non these\nagricultural\ncommoditiesSugar61-80SourcedIn addition to water, the principal raw materials used in our business are nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners. In the United States, for example, the principal nutritive\nsweetener is high fructose corn syrup (\u201cHFCS\u201d), which is nutritionally equivalent to sugar. The principal nutritive sweetener used by our business outside the United States\nis sucrose, i.e., refined sugar from sugar cane or beet. Our selection of \"sugar\" above represents a combination of both HFCS and sucrose as described here. The\nnutritive sweeteners used in the finished products are purchased, in some cases by The Company and in other cases by our independent bottling partners. This split of\nnutritive sweetener sourcing notwithstanding, 61-80% of our revenue is dependent upon this agricultural commodity. Through water footprinting studies across our value\nchain, we know that approximately 85% of the total water footprint of our products comes from our agricultural ingredient supply chain, particularly farming. We currently\nestimate the water footprint of cane sugar is 1700 l/kg; of corn 1200 l/kg and of beet sugar 920 l/kg; however, the impact of these footprints for sugar differs greatly\ndepending on levels of water-stress and of the presence of irrigation. A Global Enterprise Water Footprint Study, which is being currently undertaken, alongside additional\nrisk assessments to determine water stressed sourcing regions, will further inform our understanding of water impacts of sugar sourcing.21-40SourcedOther, please\nspecify\n(Orange)In 2019, juice from oranges (the largest volume of fruit we source by far) accounted for 21-40% of our revenue. Most of our orange juice is procured by a central\nprocurement team, sometimes together with our Coca-Cola bottling partners. Through water footprinting studies across our value chain, we know that approximately 85%\nof the total water footprint of our products comes from our agricultural ingredient supply chain, particularly farming. We estimate that the water footprint of oranges , is 560\nl/kg and most groves are irrigated. The impact of this footprint depends greatly on levels of water-stress.

Baseline water stress is an indicator of competition for water\nresources and is defined informally as the ratio of demand for water by human society divided by available water. It is also commonly known as the\nwithdrawals-to-availability ratio. Baseline water stress measures the ratio of total annual water withdrawals, from industry, domestic and agricultural\nusers, to average annual available renewable supplies.

If we are discharging to a utility for further\ntreatment, our facilities ensure that we also meet the pre-treatment requirements of such utilities, and the ultimate discharge of the final effluent from those utilities may have\ndifferent discharge limits based on local regulations. Additionally, recommended methods listed below are required for our quarterly compliance checks performed by external\nlabs. However, there may be other analytical methods that would be more appropriate at the facility level for more routine daily and weekly verification.Below are a few of the pollutants whose monitoring is mandatory across all facilities:- Fecal coliform, via stormwater or improper treatment of wastewater. Required method of measurement: 9221E. - Ammonia, Phosphorus, via storm-water, or improper treatment of wastewater. Required method of measurement: 4500 - NH3, 4500 - P- Total Suspended Solids, via improper treatment of wastewater or stormwater. Required method of measurement: 2540D- BOD5, via improper treatment of wastewater or stormwater.  Required method of measurement: 5210BOur approach and policies do not vary and are consistent across the value chain. In our value chain we work with our suppliers and supply chains. Our Supplier Guiding\nPrinciples (SGPs) and Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGPs) set out the requirements The Coca-Cola Company expects all of our suppliers to comply with,\nincluding requirements on water management (including pollutants), and minimizing water quality impacts from wastewater discharges and erosion, and nutrient/agrochemical\nrunoff.  We work together with and approve certification schemes such as Bonsucro, SAI and others for sustainable ingredient sourcing, all of which include extensive water\nmanagement requirements, including water pollutant management, from measuring abstractions, implementing water efficient irrigation technologies and managing run-off.   The impacts of these pollutants are on nearby water bodies and watersheds, affecting entire local ecosystems and all water users, including our own bottling facilities as we\ndraw from these watersheds. In our supply chain, our agricultural suppliers could experience detrimental impacts to their own crop yields and impact water users in their\nsurrounding communities, as well as ecosystems, if pollutants are not managed correctly. Some pollutants may impact surface and ground water quality. Fertilizers and other\npollutants could cause a potential change in pH, increase the amount of eutrophication in the water, or depending on the type, cause algae or other microorganisms to grow\nin excess. This could result in impacts on aquatic and natural life across ecosystems and enter watersheds, affecting local fauna as well as broader ecosystems and human\nhealth, as well as potentially disrupting various uses of water, including industrial uses, if untreated.W-FB3.1aCDPPage 13 of 58\f"

Not only do nearly all of our products contain water as the most critical main ingredient, but water is also essential to growing the agricultural\ningredients and producing the packaging and other essential materials that are critical in producing and delivering our products to market. Adverse impacts on water availability or\nquality in our supply chains could have significant implications in our capability to produce or the cost of our product and therefore the profitability and growth potential of the business.\nThe tools used to assess the implications of water to our key commodities and raw materials are WRI Aqueduct, balanced scorecards with our suppliers, and our internal tracking of\ncompliance to our Supplier Agricultural Guiding Principles. First, using WRI Aqueduct, we make a global assessment of the sourcing regions of our agricultural commodities that we\npurchase, and the water stress or scarcity of those geographies in order to map and prioritize our efforts. In parallel, we engage with suppliers through our procurement function, in\nwhich suppliers are assessed through balanced scorecards, which score suppliers on areas including quality, safety, environmental management and sustainability. A key feature of\nsupplier engagement is a requirement for all suppliers to adhere to our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGPs), and all agricultural ingredient suppliers to comply with our Sustainable\nAgriculture Guiding Principles (SAGPs), which set out compliance requirements for all suppliers, including requirements on water management, and minimizing water quality impacts\nfrom wastewater discharges and erosion, and nutrient/agrochemical runoff. Suppliers demonstrate SAGP compliance primarily by receiving certification from sustainable ingredient\nsourcing certification schemes with whom we work together or support. These sustainable agriculture standards and assurance schemes all include extensive water management\nrequirements, including water pollutant management, from measuring abstractions, implementing water efficient irrigation technologies and managing run-off. The Farm Sustainability\nAssessment of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform, the Bonsucro sustainable sugarcane standard and Rainforest Alliance certifications are some of the leading standards\nwe support. Suppliers are audited on their compliance with these principles on a yearly basis.In all geographies and areas in which we operate, the use of water is impacted by local regulations and regulatory frameworks. Without effective governance and regulations,\nsustainable water use in some cases could come under risk. Additionally, effective regulation could unlock many opportunities and benefits for both the local communities and\nbusiness, potentially impacting community well-being, business productivity and levels of cost and capacity. We conduct global, plant-level water risk assessments to inform our global\nwater strategy on an approximate triennial frequency, across a 10-year risk horizon, which is then reviewed and updated annually. The process involves a detailed, plant-level survey\nfor each facility, extensive geospatial monitoring of various factors affecting water and a risk quantification model. The tools used are WRI Aqueduct and our internal, proprietary\nFacility Water Vulnerability Assessment tool, which collates all historical data and analysis conducted since our global program commenced in 2004. First, using WRI Aqueduct, we\nmake a global assessment of all of our operational sites globally and the respective level of water stress or scarcity in the geography in which each site operates. We then conduct a\ndetailed site-level survey using the Facility Water Vulnerability Assessment tool that covers 72 potential vulnerabilities, spread across 20 risk categories for every site, including\nassessment of risk related to water-related regulatory frameworks. Regulation is a critical topic, for which 20 relevant vulnerabilities are considered across the following risk categories:\nInfrastructure, Water Supply Policy, Water Efficiency Practices, Waste Water Compliance, Water Quality Compliance, Water Cost, Regulations, Access to Safe Water and\nGovernment Interactions. Our standards require that all production facilities form and train a comprehensive water resource management team, work with expert(s) to complete a\nsource vulnerability assessment (SVA) that inventories risks specific to the water source, prepare a source water protection plan (SWPP) with actions, roles, responsibilities and\nfunding needs, and execute the plan, and to review the plan and progress annually. For example, in Europe, the business recently led the creation of a business coalition in support of\nthe EU Water Framework Directive and is actively engaging with policy makers for preserving a strong regulatory approach to water.The status of ecosystems and habitats in our areas of operation or in our supply chain are essential in ensuring the long-term sustainability and availability of water. If these are\nimpacted or degrade, this could lead to the degradation of sustainable and quality water availability, potentially impacting community well-being, business productivity and levels of\ncost and ability to produce. We have aligned our risk assessment and management processes with the Alliance for Water Stewardship standard. We conduct global water risk\nmapping and plant-level water risk assessments across all facilities to inform our global water strategy on an approximate triennial frequency, across a 10-year risk horizon, which is\nthen reviewed and updated annually. The process involves a detailed, plant-level survey for each facility, extensive geospatial monitoring of various factors affecting water and a risk\nquantification model. The tools used are WRI Aqueduct and our internal, proprietary Facility Water Vulnerability Assessment tool, which collates all historical data and analysis\nconducted since our global program commenced in 2004. First, using WRI Aqueduct, we make a global assessment of all of our operational sites globally and the respective level of\nwater stress or scarcity in the geography in which each site operates. We then conduct a detailed site-level survey using the Facility Water Vulnerability Assessment tool that covers\n72 potential vulnerabilities, spread across 20 risk categories for every site, including assessment of risk related to status of ecosystems and habitats. There are 5 relevant potential\nvulnerabilities considered for this issue across the following risk categories: Watershed Vulnerability, Water Quality Deterioration & Fluctuations, and Community Conflict. Based on\nthe findings, our internal global standards require that all production facilities form and train a comprehensive water resource management team, work with expert(s) to complete a\nsource vulnerability assessment (SVA) that inventories risks specific to our water source, prepare a source water protection plan (SWPP) with actions, roles, responsibilities and\nfunding needs, and execute the plan, and to review the plan and progress annually. In our updated strategy, the health of ecosystems and habitats will be further integrated into our\naction plans to support watershed health, which will be guided by a watershed health scorecard, including ecosystem and habitat aspects.Ensuring all facilities provide fully-functioning, safely managed WASH services for all employees is fundamental to the health, safety and well-being of our employees. Requirements\nto this effect are included in our global standard operating procedures (KORE). As a food & beverage business, ensuring advanced WASH practices in all Coca-Cola system facilities\nis critical for product integrity and we monitor for 100% compliance with our internal operating requirements, which includes a full compliance requirement on basic food-safety\nstandards such as PD ISO/TS 22002-1, Prerequisite Programs on Food Safety, and FSSC 22000. The company also supports the WASH4WORK framework and will continue to\nreview its guidance and procedures for owned operations, the bottling system and suppliers with regards to WASH for employees. The tool used is our internal, proprietary Facility\nWater Vulnerability Assessment tool, which collates all historical data and analysis conducted since our global program commenced in 2004. We conduct global water risk mapping\nand plant-level water risk assessments across all facilities using this tool, and we conduct a detailed site-level survey that covers 72 potential vulnerabilities, spread across 20 risk\ncategories for every site, including assessment of risk related to employee WASH access. This specific risk factor is included in our list of 72 vulnerabilities, under the risk category of\nAccess to Safe Water. Based on the findings, our internal global standards require that all production facilities complete a source vulnerability assessment (SVA) that inventories any\nrisks found specific to our water source, prepare a mitigating source water protection plan (SWPP) with actions, roles, responsibilities and funding needs, and execute the plan. In\nmany of our markets, the employee WASH requirement is also assessed, monitored and implemented as part of our Quality, Safety and Environmental function.Water-related\nregulatory\nframeworksRelevant,\nalways\nincludedStatus of\necosystems and\nhabitatsRelevant,\nalways\nincludedRelevant,\nalways\nincludedAccess to fully-\nfunctioning,\nsafely managed\nWASH services\nfor all employeesOther contextual\nissues, please\nspecifyRelevant,\nalways\nincludedThe Coca-Cola Company's water leadership was born in India more than two decades ago, following a conflict between our business and the local community over the use of local\nwater resources. This moment led us to examine and better understand water risks to our company and the communities in which we operate, looking well beyond the four walls of our\nfacilities and into our supply chain. It also led to our pioneering goal, established 10 years ago, to replenish the water we used in the production of our beverages. At the time, the goal\nwas a leap of faith. But we met and exceeded it, and other companies have followed suit. We continue to meet and exceed the target each year since 2015 when we first met the\ntarget. As we transition into the next decade of our water strategy, we recognize that it is important to continue performing against the targets that we set for ourselves, as this\ncontinues to form part of our license to operate. We will make water replenishment a contributing factor of achieving overall watershed health and focus action on the most water\nstressed regions.(W3.3c) Which of the following stakeholders are considered in your organization\u2019s water-related risk assessments?W3.3cCustomersPlease explainRelevance\n&\ninclusionRelevant,\nalways\nincludedEmployeesRelevant,\nalways\nincludedWe are a business-to-business company. Our finished products are sold to customers, which can be very large to very small retailers (grocery stores), restaurants, hotels, catering\ncompanies, leisure and entertainment parks etc. As a result, customers' voices and requirements are vital in considering our water-related policies, risks and strategies. The following\nare examples of our methods of engagement with customers in water-related risk assessments and relevant examples: - As significant water users in their own operations: for\nexample, Hotels and catering businesses tend to use a lot of water and we have engaged with a number of our leading customers (e.g. Hilton Group) in the US and Europe to help\nthem understand their water risks, share our approaches and advise on water efficiency. - As major indirect users of water through their supply chains, agricultural produce is a major\nwater user for many of our retail customers, e.g. in their fresh produce supply chain. We seek to engage customers on sustainable agriculture where we have common supply chains,\nfor example on fruit (for fresh and juice). For example, in Spain (Huelva region), we helped bring together retail customers like Migros and M&S to work with us and our suppliers on\nwater-efficient strawberry farming. - As a major touchpoint for awareness raising on water with consumers: Retailers are the touchpoint of our brands with the consumers. We engage\ncustomers to partner on the Point of Sales to raise awareness on water with our consumers. For example, we supported Metro Group in a multi-country consumer activation on world\nwater day to raise awareness and funds for water projects in India.Employee engagement is critical for the success of our business and the achievement of water goals. We engage our employees across the system to embed our business objectives\nin the day-to-day way of doing business, especially as we have such a vast operational footprint. Also, employee engagement surveys show how important our work on sustainability,\nincluding water, is for employee loyalty and engagement. Our method of engagement is as follows: We inform and engage employees on water in different ways, through our intranet\n(Connect) or corporate website, internal newsletters (company and bottlers), specific communications on major water events like World Water Day, Global Water Summit and\nStockholm Water Week. Depending on what works best on local level, we also take employees on community days to water projects and field visits to support our partners and raise\nawareness. environmental awards for our bottlers include water performance and reward best in class and best performer bottlers. As a food & beverage business, ensuring\nadvanced WASH practices in all Coca-Cola system facilities is critical for product integrity and we monitor for 100% compliance with our internal operating requirements, which\nincludes a full compliance requirement on basic food-safety standards such as PD ISO/TS 22002-1, Prerequisite Programs on Food Safety, and FSSC 22000.CDPPage 17 of 58\f"

As such, these local water utilities are key stakeholders, and at the local level across our global system, our\noperational entities engage with them on an ongoing basis. Each bottling facility is required to conduct a site-level survey using the internal, proprietary Facility Water Vulnerability\nAssessment tool that covers 72 potential vulnerabilities, spread across 20 risk categories for every site, including assessment of risk related to local water utilities and evaluating\npublic sector local and regional water resource medium and long-term planning. Based on the findings of each local bottling facility, our internal global standards require that all\nproduction facilities form and train a comprehensive water resource management team, work with expert(s) to complete a source vulnerability assessment (SVA) that inventories these\nrisks, prepare a source water protection plan (SWPP) with actions, roles, responsibilities and funding needs, and execute the plan, and to review the plan and progress annually. Our\nmethod for engagement with local water utilities is through sharing knowledge and best practice. In several regions, for example in sub-saharan Africa, the local water utilies have\nmajor capability challenges , especially around leakage management, non-revenue water, waste water treatment etc. Our bottling partners (e.g. CCBA, CCHBC) work with the local\nregulators and utilities to share knowledge and best practice. In Capetown, our local bottler Coca-Cola Peninsula Beverages worked actively with the local utility on developing an\nalternative water supply strategy and to reduce supply pressure on the municipal provider. As part of our access to water program, the RAIN (Replenish Africa Initiative) is supporting\nwork led by WSUP (Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor, for example in Madagascar, to strengthen the utility of the capital and enable it to expand services to 480.000\nunderserved people.Other\nstakeholder,\nplease specifyRelevant,\nalways\nincludedOur source water protection program requires that each facility, as part of their source water vulnerability assessment, evaluate public sector local and regional water resource master\nand long-term planning. Such assessments are required to be maintained and updated on five-year intervals, or sooner, as conditions warrant. As an when additional stakeholders are\nidentified as relevant at a local level, they are always included in the assessment of risk and opportunity for the relevant plant or local entity.W3.3d(W3.3d) Describe your organization\u2019s process for identifying, assessing, and responding to water-related risks within your direct operations and other stages of\nyour value chain.In our operations, we have a 4-step process for identifying, assessing and responding to water-related risk. Step 1 is a global enterprise water risk assessment, using WRI Aqueduct, covering all production facilities globally. The work assesses baseline water stress, projected water\nstress to 2030, water quality challenges and access to water and sanitation (WASH) challenges, for direct operations and key agricultural commodities. Step 2 is to overlay relevant data points such as population data and urbanization rates and to understand and prioritize our work.  Our latest such work is the basis of our\ndisclosure in this response, for facilities and ingredient sourcing regions located in areas of water stress. It is repeated on a triennial basis, or as conditions warrant. Step 3 is to collect plant-level feedback of potential risks in a Facility Water Vulnerability Assessment. The assessment covers 72 potential vulnerabilities across 20 risk\ncategories, completed by our local teams in every geography of operation, the assessment splits into the following six thematic areas:  1. Supply reliability, 2. Water\nefficiency, 3. Water Economics, 4. Product Quality and Safety 5.  Watershed sustainability, 6. Local / Social Issues.Step 4 is to apply our global standards on water resource sustainability, which, based on findings from the assessments above, require all production facilities to: 1. Form a\nwater resource management team; 2. With expert(s), complete a Source Vulnerability Assessment (SVA) to inventory and fully assess all identified risks; 3. Prepare a Source\nWater Protection Plan (SWPP) with actions, roles, responsibilities and funding needs; 4. Implement the SWPP; and 5. Review the SVA and SWPP annually. The outcomes have informed decision-making as per below:The categorization of water stress-levels resulting from Steps 1 and 2 (WRI Aqueduct water-risk mapping and further prioritization by data overlays) have allowed the\nbusiness to segment our global facility locations in order of priority, creating the foundation for our business to explore context-based water targets, based on the requirements\nof each local context.  Additionally, the local assessments in Steps 3 and 4, following from the water-risk mapping, provide an indication of where and what kinds of projects\nthe business should invest in locally, in order to help regenerate watersheds and replenish the water that we use in our operations. For example, much of India faces high to\nextremely high water stress, according to WRI, and TCCC has 9 owned bottling facilities in the country located in such areas. Taking these outcomes and identifying the\nspecific, local needs for protecting source water and managing vulnerabilities, the local team has identified a multitude of ongoing initiatives and projects. As one example,\ncapturing seasonal monsoon rains, for example through the construction of check dams and rainwater harvesting structures, is critical in rural area to address flooding and\nquality impacts of stormwater. Since 2009, The Coca-Cola India Foundation has created more than 13 billion liters of water replenishment potential through 150 community\nwater conservation projects, impacting over 600,000 lives across 500+ villages in remote and water-stressed areas across India.In our value chain, we assess the implications of water risk to our key commodities and raw materials first using WRI Aqueduct. We make a global assessment of the sourcing\nregions of our agricultural commodities that we purchase, and the water stress levels of those geographies in order to map and prioritize our efforts. In addition, we apply\nseveral criteria such as spend, strategic importance, and sustainability risk to prioritize the ingredients we track. We are currently tracking 13 global priority ingredients\nrepresenting about 80% of our total annual agricultural ingredient purchases.As our method of engagement, we require all agricultural suppliers to adhere to our Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGPs), which set out compliance\nrequirements for all suppliers, including requirements on water management, and minimizing water quality impacts from wastewater discharges and erosion, and\nnutrient/agrochemical runoff.  Suppliers demonstrate SAGP compliance primarily by receiving certification from sustainable ingredient sourcing certification schemes with\nwhom we work together or support. These sustainable agriculture standards and assurance schemes all include extensive water management requirements. The Farm\nSustainability Assessment of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform, the Bonsucro sustainable sugarcane standard and Rainforest Alliance certifications are some of\nthe leading standards we support. Suppliers are audited on their compliance with these principles on a yearly basis. Of our 13 global priority ingredients, in 2019, 54% of\nthese ingredient volumes were SAGP-compliant (up from 8% in 2013, the beginning of the program).CDPPage 19 of 58\f"

Our business uses a significant volume of corn-derived\nsweetener, high fructose corn syrup, as a sweetener in our beverages in many of key markets, including the United States of America. If the production of corn is impacted,\na significant portion of our product portfolio in this market will be directly impacted, through cost and availability impacts of a key ingredient. Roughly 29% of of our global\nportfolio is now low or no-calories. The remainder of that portfolio uses either sugar or corn-derived sweetener. Specifically, in the United States, these products use corn-\nderived sweeteners, nearly all grown in the United States. Based on our climate-related priority risk assessment, we understand that the chronic physical impacts of climate\nchange, namely changes in precipitation patterns, temperature variability and changes in weather patterns, are expected to have a significant impact on our agricultural\nsupply chains, which will be felt through the variability in the availability and stress of water resources. Through product water footprinting exercises, we also have\nascertained that for some of our products, 80% of our water use sits within the agricultural supply chain, making this portion of our water usage particularly significant. As a\nresult of these assessments, we understand that if the production of corn is impacted in the United States, a significant portion of our product portfolio in the US will be\ndirectly impacted, potentially increasing cost and creating challenges on the availability of sourcing for a key ingredient. We therefore consider the water-related risks in the\ngrowing (i.e. sourcing) of this raw material to be a critical risk to monitor and understand.Timeframe\n4-6 yearsLikelihood\nLikelyMagnitude of potential impact\nHighAre you able to provide a potential financial impact figure?\nYes, an estimated rangePotential financial impact figure (currency)\n<Not Applicable>Potential financial impact figure - minimum (currency)\n1580000000Potential financial impact figure - maximum (currency)\n4552000000Explanation of financial impact\nThis is the amount of current revenue that is dependent specifically on corn sourced from the United States, which is the scope of this risk calculation. Assumptions below: -\nNet operating revenue (public data) for North America Operating Group is used as an input. - USA revenue breaks down proportional to its UC volume share within the NA\nOG. - Global percentage of low or no-calorie beverages in our portfolio (29%) is applicable as an average to the USA market. - Low end of range = exposed to risk only in\nlocations of extremely high water stress. - High end of range = exposed to risk in locations of both high and extremely high water stress. Estimated exposure was calculated\nby taking North America Operating Group revenue, multiplying the volume share of USA, and further applying % of portfolio that use corn-derived sweetener, based on\nassumption above. We then multiply the % of our corn that we believe may be exposed to risk due to water stress based on climate change impacts.Primary response to riskSupplier engagementOther, please specify (Drive the adoption of sustainable sourcing certification by suppliers as a way of improving the resilience of our agricultural supply chains, )Description of response\nIn 2013, we set a goal to more sustainably source our priority ingredients by 2020. Corn is one of our priority ingredients, in the form of High Fructose Corn Syrup. We\nrequire that our suppliers meet our 15 Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGP), which establish the framework for progress and are integrated into governance\nprocurement processes. As a case study specifically on corn, we advance our sustainable sourcing through membership in Field to Market: The Alliance for Sustainable\nAgriculture, through which we work on more sustainable corn production in the United States. With our four biggest corn suppliers, we are aiming to fulfill a 2014\ncommitment to expand the application of Field to Market\u2019s Fieldprint\u00ae Platform, a data-driven tool that quantifies water use, energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and\nother measures of sustainability performance. The target is to engage corn farmers representing 1 million acres by 2020, which would position The Coca-Cola Company\nwith 100% more sustainable corn production in the U.S. market. As a result of such work, our global % of corn sourced from sustainable sources has moved into the 51 -\n75% range, up from 0 - 25% in 2016 and 2017.Cost of response\n100000Explanation of cost of response\nThe cost of response to this risk is the total annual contribution from The Coca-Cola Company's to select platforms such as Field to Market, or the SAI platform to promote\nthe advancement of sustainable sourcing and raise awareness at a global level.CDPPage 25 of 58\f"

Through improved water-use efficiency,\nwe estimate we have been able to avoid and estimated US$1 billion cumulatively in costs from 2011 through 2020, through our water efficiency projects, primarily by\nreducing the amount of water purchased, as well as on the associated costs of internal operations and handling of water, as well as fees associated with water discharge.(W5.1) For each facility referenced in W4.1c, provide coordinates, water accounting data, and a comparison with the previous reporting year.United Republic of TanzaniaOther, please specify (East Central Coast - Great Ruaha 2)Page 26 of 58\f"

It assessed Acute physical, Chronic physical and Transitional risks across a 10-year timescale, through a host of internal and external information and interviews, and\nidentified both a BAU and 2 degree scenario for scenario analysis.(W7.3a) Has your organization identified any water-related outcomes from your climate-related scenario analysis?\nYes(W7.3b) What water-related outcomes were identified from the use of climate-related scenario analysis, and what was your organization\u2019s response?Description of possible water-related outcomesCompany response to possible water-related outcomesThe identified priority water-related risks are split between the two scenarios. In a \"BAU\"\nworld, for which we used the IEA World Energy Outlook \"New Policies\" scenario, the\nfollowing are the top priority risks: - Changes to weather and precipitation patterns limiting\nthe availability of ingredients and raw materials: In the United States, we use corn-derived\nsweeteners. Impact on this agricultural supply chain will be felt through the variability in\nthe availability and stress of water resources, and will impact our ability to produce,\nresulting in a potential total financial exposure of USD1.88-4.55 billion, based on the\namount of revenue dependent on this commodity. - Water scarcity disrupting sourcing\nand/or production: In India, we have 10 facilities that are located in areas considered to\nbe either Extremely high or High in water stress. This means we have a total potential\nfinancial exposure of 811 - 964 million USD, based on the amount of revenue generated\nwithin those regions. In a \"2-Degree\" world, the following are considered the primary\nrisks, as well as some of the above risks, to a lesser degree, continuing to have impacts: -\nGHG and/or water regulations increasing COGS (GHG) or disrupting production (Water) -\nChanges to consumer perceptions affecting corporate reputationThroughout 2019, a comprehensive review of our global strategy was conducted, with participation from\nall geographies, business units and key bottling partners, on a time horizon of 2030. In this long-term\nstrategy review, the following long-term water-related issues were considered: - Heightened Water-\nStress - Deteriorating Water Quality - Potential Growth Limitations - Higher Business Demand for Water -\nGrowing Exposure to Supply Chain Water Risks - Social License to operate - Regulation and Taxation\nThe water-related outcomes of our climate-related scenario analysis were integrated into the review of\nour global strategy framework. As a result, a strong link between the impacts of climate change and\nwater-related outcomes has been drawn, and our management of the water-related outcomes of climate\nchange features as a key component of our global water sustainability strategy. Specifically, this means\nthat our global water risk assessments, our Facility Water Vulnerability Assessment, and Source\nVulnerability Assessments, which are the key components of our updated global water sustainability\nstrategy, will feature climate change impacts as a core element against which to assess our risks. This\nupdated strategy will roll out in 2021, and all assessments and targets will be set on a 2030 timeline.\nBased on our facility and geography-specific risk assessments, our updated strategy will feature\ncontext-specific targets, tying in the various long-term impacts above.W7.3CommentUse of\nclimate-\nrelated\nscenario\nanalysisYesRow\n1W7.3aW7.3bRow\n1Climate-\nrelated\nscenarios\nand\nmodels\nappliedOther,\nplease\nspecify\n(IEA WEO\nNew\nPolicies\nScenario,\nREMIND\nIAM 2C\nScenario)W7.4CDPPage 53 of 58\f"

A large proportion of our\nrevenue is directly tied to products that require water as a critical ingredient and water is essential to our operational processes, used in each step of production, including\ncleaning, heating and cooling. As we continue to grow our business and increase sales of our products, the amount of our revenue dependent on water will increase and so\nour future water dependency will also continue to increase. However, with continued efforts to reduce our water usage through increased water efficiency and reuse, we aim to\ndecouple volume growth from water use as much as possible. Indirect Use: Good quality water is vital to ensuring a sustainable supply of the agricultural ingredients,\npackaging, and other key materials we use in our products. Through water footprinting studies across our value chain, we know that approximately 85% of the total water\nfootprint of our products comes from our agricultural ingredient supply chain. We also recognize that access to safe water for drinking and sanitation is essential to the\ncommunities where we operate and across our value chain. Our plans to diversify our portfolio and increase volumes in products such as tea, coffee, dairy, fruit and nuts will\nlikely increase our future water dependency in indirect usage, as these ingredients are often highly water intensive. Through our water replenish projects with farmers to\nimprove productive use of water and our sustainable agriculture program, we will continue to work with our agriculture supply chain to improve water management practices\nand water efficiency.Direct use: Our direct use of re-used/recycled water is limited to non-product activities, such as cleaning-in-place processes and water treatment operations, and we directly\nsource very little brackish and/or produced water. Therefore, the direct use importance rating of recycled, brackish and/or produced water is neutral. For recycling processes,\nmany of our facilities across the system have implemented water recovery systems meeting the highest quality standards, and where applicable expanding the use of such\nwater sources, helping minimize our environmental impacts. Future water dependency of this type of water is expected to increase moderately given our ambition to increase\nregenerative water use as part of our 2030 water strategy that is currently being finalized. Indirect use: Recycled, brackish or other types of water can be treated and used in\nour agricultural supply chains, including for irrigation purposes. Continued access to sufficient amounts of such water is important to help to reduce freshwater extraction,\nreducing the impact on water tables, and improving local water availability. This is particularly critical in water stressed areas where we source our ingredients. As we continue\nto grow our business, diversify our portfolio and increase our sourcing volumes in products such as tea, coffee, dairy and fruit we expect that our future water dependency on\nthis type of water will increase in our agricultural supply chains. In addition, several of our major sourcing regions are expected to undergo increasing water stress due to the\nimpacts of climate change which will further decrease the amount of available freshwater and increase our reliance on recycled water.

In the United States, for example, the principal nutritive\nsweetener is high fructose corn syrup (\u201cHFCS\u201d), which is nutritionally equivalent to sugar. The principal nutritive sweetener used by our business outside the United States\nis sucrose, i.e., refined sugar from sugar cane or beet. Our selection of \"sugar\" above represents a combination of both HFCS and sucrose as described here. The\nnutritive sweeteners used in the finished products are purchased, in some cases by The Company and in other cases by our independent bottling partners. This split of\nnutritive sweetener sourcing notwithstanding, 61-80% of our revenue is dependent upon this agricultural commodity. Through water footprinting studies across our value\nchain, we know that approximately 85% of the total water footprint of our products comes from our agricultural ingredient supply chain, particularly farming. We currently\nestimate the water footprint of cane sugar is 1700 l/kg; of corn 1200 l/kg and of beet sugar 920 l/kg; however, the impact of these footprints for sugar differs greatly\ndepending on levels of water-stress and of the presence of irrigation.

      "value": "(W1.1) Rate the importance (current and future) of water quality and water quantity to the success of your business.Please explainDirect use\nimportance\nratingIndirect\nuse\nimportance\nratingVitalImportantNeutralImportantDirect Use: As a beverage company, access to sufficient amounts of high-quality freshwater is vital to the long-term sustainability of our company. A large proportion of our\nrevenue is directly tied to products that require water as a critical ingredient and water is essential to our operational processes, used in each step of production, including\ncleaning, heating and cooling. As we continue to grow our business and increase sales of our products, the amount of our revenue dependent on water will increase and so\nour future water dependency will also continue to increase. However, with continued efforts to reduce our water usage through increased water efficiency and reuse, we aim to\ndecouple volume growth from water use as much as possible. Indirect Use: Good quality water is vital to ensuring a sustainable supply of the agricultural ingredients,\npackaging, and other key materials we use in our products. Through water footprinting studies across our value chain, we know that approximately 85% of the total water\nfootprint of our products comes from our agricultural ingredient supply chain. We also recognize that access to safe water for drinking and sanitation is essential to the\ncommunities where we operate and across our value chain. Our plans to diversify our portfolio and increase volumes in products such as tea, coffee, dairy, fruit and nuts will\nlikely increase our future water dependency in indirect usage, as these ingredients are often highly water intensive. Through our water replenish projects with farmers to\nimprove productive use of water and our sustainable agriculture program, we will continue to work with our agriculture supply chain to improve water management practices\nand water efficiency.Direct use: Our direct use of re-used/recycled water is limited to non-product activities, such as cleaning-in-place processes and water treatment operations, and we directly\nsource very little brackish and/or produced water. Therefore, the direct use importance rating of recycled, brackish and/or produced water is neutral. For recycling processes,\nmany of our facilities across the system have implemented water recovery systems meeting the highest quality standards, and where applicable expanding the use of such\nwater sources, helping minimize our environmental impacts. Future water dependency of this type of water is expected to increase moderately given our ambition to increase\nregenerative water use as part of our 2030 water strategy that is currently being finalized. Indirect use: Recycled, brackish or other types of water can be treated and used in\nour agricultural supply chains, including for irrigation purposes. Continued access to sufficient amounts of such water is important to help to reduce freshwater extraction,\nreducing the impact on water tables, and improving local water availability. This is particularly critical in water stressed areas where we source our ingredients. As we continue\nto grow our business, diversify our portfolio and increase our sourcing volumes in products such as tea, coffee, dairy and fruit we expect that our future water dependency on\nthis type of water will increase in our agricultural supply chains. In addition, several of our major sourcing regions are expected to undergo increasing water stress due to the\nimpacts of climate change which will further decrease the amount of available freshwater and increase our reliance on recycled water. Again, through our water replenish\nprojects with farmers and our sustainable agriculture program, we will continue to work with our agriculture supply chain to improve water management practices and improve\nwater efficiency.(W-FB1.1a) Which water-intensive agricultural commodities that your organization produces and/or sources are the most significant to your business by\nrevenue? Select up to five.Agricultural\ncommoditiesPlease explainProduced\nand/or\nsourced% of\nrevenue\ndependent\non these\nagricultural\ncommoditiesSugar61-80SourcedIn addition to water, the principal raw materials used in our business are nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners. In the United States, for example, the principal nutritive\nsweetener is high fructose corn syrup (\u201cHFCS\u201d), which is nutritionally equivalent to sugar. The principal nutritive sweetener used by our business outside the United States\nis sucrose, i.e., refined sugar from sugar cane or beet. Our selection of \"sugar\" above represents a combination of both HFCS and sucrose as described here. The\nnutritive sweeteners used in the finished products are purchased, in some cases by The Company and in other cases by our independent bottling partners. This split of\nnutritive sweetener sourcing notwithstanding, 61-80% of our revenue is dependent upon this agricultural commodity. Through water footprinting studies across our value\nchain, we know that approximately 85% of the total water footprint of our products comes from our agricultural ingredient supply chain, particularly farming. We currently\nestimate the water footprint of cane sugar is 1700 l/kg; of corn 1200 l/kg and of beet sugar 920 l/kg; however, the impact of these footprints for sugar differs greatly\ndepending on levels of water-stress and of the presence of irrigation. A Global Enterprise Water Footprint Study, which is being currently undertaken, alongside additional\nrisk assessments to determine water stressed sourcing regions, will further inform our understanding of water impacts of sugar sourcing.21-40SourcedOther, please\nspecify\n(Orange)In 2019, juice from oranges (the largest volume of fruit we source by far) accounted for 21-40% of our revenue. Most of our orange juice is procured by a central\nprocurement team, sometimes together with our Coca-Cola bottling partners. Through water footprinting studies across our value chain, we know that approximately 85%\nof the total water footprint of our products comes from our agricultural ingredient supply chain, particularly farming. We estimate that the water footprint of oranges , is 560\nl/kg and most groves are irrigated. The impact of this footprint depends greatly on levels of water-stress.

Our volume of water drawn from freshwater has remained about the same, decreasing slightly by\n209 megaliters from 2018 to 2019. The volume has changed from the previous reporting year because of a general trend toward using\ngroundwater renewable sources and third-party sources instead of fresh surface water, since they are more sustainable and more easily-\nmanaged sources of water supply.There are cases in which sources other than groundwater, municipal water supply, or freshwater are our best and most consistent and\nsustainable sources of water. in these cases, we use these water sources with the required pre-treatment needed for our required influent quality\nlevels. However, the volume of water withdrawn from this type of source is small, relative to our overall withdrawal figures. The usage of this type\nof water increased by 1,999 megaliters compared to last year. The volume has changed from the previous reporting year because some locations\nwith access to brackish surface water have chosen to leverage these water sources instead of renewable groundwater sources. This remains a\nvery minor share of our total withdrawals.Groundwater is tracked as one category. Our extensive business-level risk assessment, source vulnerability assessments, and source water\nprotection program address the sustainability of ground water at each location. Groundwater is often the most reliable, sustainable and\nconsistent source for water in the geographies in which we operate, that is most often conducive to monitoring, managing and controlling the\nquality and sustainability of the source water consistently.

Our use of water from third party sources\nincreased by 12,213 megaliters from 2018 to 2019.

However, the volume of water withdrawn from this type of source is small, relative to our overall withdrawal figures. The usage of this type\nof water increased by 1,999 megaliters compared to last year. The volume has changed from the previous reporting year because some locations\nwith access to brackish surface water have chosen to leverage these water sources instead of renewable groundwater sources.

      "value": "(W-FB3.1) How does your organization identify and classify potential water pollutants associated with its food, beverage, and tobacco sector activities that could\nhave a detrimental impact on water ecosystems or human health?The Coca-Cola Company has strict requirements for influent and effluent water quality at our facilities, as well as those at our bottling partners, and we require strict\nadherence to these standards, or local regulatory standards, whichever standard is more stringent. We have a goal to require all plants to meet strict standards to treat and\nreturn the water we use in our manufacturing process back to nature at a level that supports aquatic life, even when not required or requested by local governments and\ncommunities. To this end, our internal requirements promote effective and responsible water use, treatment and disposal at a level that supports aquatic life. It is applied\nthroughout the value chain to all facilities globally with the potential to generate wastewater or affect stormwater. The internal requirements cover 11 pollutants as mandatory\nin all facilities across the globe. If there are any legal requirements in the given geographical region to monitor additional pollutants not covered within these 11 pollutants,\nthese would be added to the list of mandatory pollutants to monitor. In addition, business units are required to assess and monitor an additional list of 9 pollutants, considering specific local circumstances. This assessment is conducted\nthrough what internally is called a Facility Water Vulnerability Assessments, which assesses risk across 72 potential vulnerabilities, across 20 risk categories. Of the\nvulnerabilities, at least 20 are directly or indirectly related to identifying and classifying potential water pollutants. The framework and approach is aligned with the Alliance for\nWater Stewardship Standard.The risk categories relevant to water quality / pollutants include:- Source Water Availability (Quality)- Waste Water Compliance- Water Quality Compliance- Water Quality Deterioration and Fluctuation- Ineffective Treatment of Water- Watershed Vulnerability- Impact of Regulations on Watersheds and Water QualityAcceptability limits are set for discharges directly to the environment following secondary treatment of the wastewater on-site.  If we are discharging to a utility for further\ntreatment, our facilities ensure that we also meet the pre-treatment requirements of such utilities, and the ultimate discharge of the final effluent from those utilities may have\ndifferent discharge limits based on local regulations. Additionally, recommended methods listed below are required for our quarterly compliance checks performed by external\nlabs. However, there may be other analytical methods that would be more appropriate at the facility level for more routine daily and weekly verification.Below are a few of the pollutants whose monitoring is mandatory across all facilities:- Fecal coliform, via stormwater or improper treatment of wastewater. Required method of measurement: 9221E. - Ammonia, Phosphorus, via storm-water, or improper treatment of wastewater. Required method of measurement: 4500 - NH3, 4500 - P- Total Suspended Solids, via improper treatment of wastewater or stormwater. Required method of measurement: 2540D- BOD5, via improper treatment of wastewater or stormwater.  Required method of measurement: 5210BOur approach and policies do not vary and are consistent across the value chain. In our value chain we work with our suppliers and supply chains. Our Supplier Guiding\nPrinciples (SGPs) and Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGPs) set out the requirements The Coca-Cola Company expects all of our suppliers to comply with,\nincluding requirements on water management (including pollutants), and minimizing water quality impacts from wastewater discharges and erosion, and nutrient/agrochemical\nrunoff.  We work together with and approve certification schemes such as Bonsucro, SAI and others for sustainable ingredient sourcing, all of which include extensive water\nmanagement requirements, including water pollutant management, from measuring abstractions, implementing water efficient irrigation technologies and managing run-off.   The impacts of these pollutants are on nearby water bodies and watersheds, affecting entire local ecosystems and all water users, including our own bottling facilities as we\ndraw from these watersheds. In our supply chain, our agricultural suppliers could experience detrimental impacts to their own crop yields and impact water users in their\nsurrounding communities, as well as ecosystems, if pollutants are not managed correctly. Some pollutants may impact surface and ground water quality. Fertilizers and other\npollutants could cause a potential change in pH, increase the amount of eutrophication in the water, or depending on the type, cause algae or other microorganisms to grow\nin excess. This could result in impacts on aquatic and natural life across ecosystems and enter watersheds, affecting local fauna as well as broader ecosystems and human\nhealth, as well as potentially disrupting various uses of water, including industrial uses, if untreated.W-FB3.1aCDPPage 13 of 58\f"

Potential pollutants impacting\nwater quality include ammonia and nitrates, two of the key pollutants outlined in The Coca-Cola Company's internal Requirements in 2015. As identified in The Coca-Cola\nCompany Water footprint sustainability assessment (WFSA), potential impacts are that nitrate and ammonia from fertilizer entering groundwater as a consequence of\nnitrate leaching from fields into the groundwater where crops are grown. Fertilizer could also pollute via stormwater, or due to improper treatment of wastewater, impacting\nnearby water bodies and watersheds, affecting entire local ecosystems and all water users. Ammonia discharges from sugar plants may also impact surface and ground\nwater quality. Our current data on water pollution risks from agriculture (e.g. the grey water component of the water footprint I sugar beet or oranges) does not show a\nsignificant risk of fertiliser run-off.

This could result in impacts on aquatic and natural life across ecosystems and enter watersheds,\naffecting local fauna as well as broader ecosystems and human health, as well as potentially disrupting various uses of water, including industrial uses, if untreated.Please explain\nAll facilities must treat waste water to meet the most stringent Company or local standards. Our global standard, in simple terms is for any effluent of a bottling facility to be\nat the level of quality that could support aquatic life. Level of contamination of food additives are detectable through the list of procedures and parameters for monitoring\ndescribed below. Our internal standards entail the following required plans with detailed guidelines and standards under each item listed below: Preliminary assessment\nincluding - Drainage plan, Stream Separation (Before treatment), Pollution prevention and Minimization. Wastewater Treatment for - Process Wastewater, Sanitary\nWastewater, Onsite Septic System, Stormwater, Non-contact cooling Water Discharge and Disposal of treated waters Landscape Irrigation greater than 20% and Land\nApplication Preventive Management - including maintenance and inspection and training The following parameters are measured for wastewater, and limits applied to each,\nto determine compliance with Company standards. These parameters are chosen on the basis of wastewater being able to support aquatic life and reduce impact to\necosystems, and can detect levels of food additive contamination. Audits are conducted regularly to ensure compliance. BOD Chlorine Color Fecal coliform Nitrogen Total\nsuspended solids Temperature variation Ammonia, total Dissolved oxygen pH Phosphorus Limits are set for each of these parameters, based on the allowable levels for\nsupporting aquatic life. Thresholds are listed on the company website here: https://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/treating-and-recycling-wastewater Success is\nmeasured by compliance to these procedures and thresholds at all of our facilities globally, according to the standards outlined above. Each facility is required to discharge\nwaste water at allowable contamination levels for supporting aquatic life, by complying with the thresholds for each of the parameters outlined above, and this is measured\nthrough regular audits by our internal technical functions, and when any contravention is discovered, by addressing these immediately. As stated in W8.1a, our company-\nwide target is to require 100% of our facilities, including those operated by franchise bottling partners, to comply to meet these standards. We require strict waste water\nquality assessment and reporting and invest in water treatment plants to ensure discharges meet criteria where infrastructure is not available.Description of water pollutant and potential impacts\nFertilizer is used in our supply chain to grow agricultural commodities such as sugar beet and cane sugar, coffee, tea, juices, and others. Potential pollutants impacting\nwater quality include ammonia and nitrates, two of the key pollutants outlined in The Coca-Cola Company's internal Requirements in 2015. As identified in The Coca-Cola\nCompany Water footprint sustainability assessment (WFSA), potential impacts are that nitrate and ammonia from fertilizer entering groundwater as a consequence of\nnitrate leaching from fields into the groundwater where crops are grown. Fertilizer could also pollute via stormwater, or due to improper treatment of wastewater, impacting\nnearby water bodies and watersheds, affecting entire local ecosystems and all water users. Ammonia discharges from sugar plants may also impact surface and ground\nwater quality. Our current data on water pollution risks from agriculture (e.g. the grey water component of the water footprint I sugar beet or oranges) does not show a\nsignificant risk of fertiliser run-off. However, a new enterprise water footprint assessment will provide further granularity of data across the value chain in 2020.Potential water pollutant\nFertilizersActivity/value chain stage\nAgriculture \u2013 supply chainManagement procedures\nSoil conservation practices\nCrop management practices\nSustainable irrigation and drainage management\nFertilizer management\nWaste water management\nFollow regulation standardsPlease explain\nOur Supplier Guiding Principles (SGPs) and Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGPs) set out the requirements The Coca-Cola Company expects all of our\nsuppliers to comply with, including requirements on water management (including pollutants), and minimizing water quality impacts from wastewater discharges and\nerosion, and nutrient/agrochemical runoff. One way we encourage suppliers to demonstrate SAGP compliance is to receive certification from sustainable ingredient\nsourcing certification schemes, with which we work together or support. These global sustainable agriculture standards and assurance schemes all include extensive water\nmanagement requirements, including water pollutant management, from measuring abstractions, implementing water efficient irrigation technologies and managing run-off.\nThe Farm Sustainability Assessment of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform, the Bonsucro sustainable sugarcane standard and Rainforest Alliance certifications\nare some of the leading standards we support. Success is measured by tracking the compliance level of our suppliers to our SAGPs. We are currently tracking SAGP\ncompliance of 13 global priority ingredients, which represent about 80% of our total annual agricultural ingredient purchases. In 2019, 54% of these ingredient volumes\nwere SAGP-compliant (up from 8% in 2013, the beginning of the program). In addition to supplier compliance with the Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles, the\ncompany is implementing a range of replenishment projects every year, which contribute to our global water replenishment target. Of the currently contributing projects,\nabout 50 work specifically with farmers in different regions of the world to contribute to reducing run-off or improving water quality. For example, project Catalyst in Australia\nhas been working with Queensland sugar farmers for the past 10 years to improve farming practices that reduce pollution run-off from fields into the waterways and to\nprotect the Great Barrier Reef. In the UK, we are working with our bottler CCEP, the sugar supplier, local farmers and conservation groups to reduce run off from sugar\nbeet farming in East Anglia and to protect the rare Chalk Streams.W3.3CDPPage 14 of 58\f"

Not only do nearly all of our products contain water as the most critical main ingredient, but water is also essential to growing the agricultural\ningredients and producing the packaging and other essential materials that are critical in producing and delivering our products to market. Adverse impacts on water availability or\nquality in our supply chains could have significant implications in our capability to produce or the cost of our product and therefore the profitability and growth potential of the business.\nThe tools used to assess the implications of water to our key commodities and raw materials are WRI Aqueduct, balanced scorecards with our suppliers, and our internal tracking of\ncompliance to our Supplier Agricultural Guiding Principles. First, using WRI Aqueduct, we make a global assessment of the sourcing regions of our agricultural commodities that we\npurchase, and the water stress or scarcity of those geographies in order to map and prioritize our efforts. In parallel, we engage with suppliers through our procurement function, in\nwhich suppliers are assessed through balanced scorecards, which score suppliers on areas including quality, safety, environmental management and sustainability. A key feature of\nsupplier engagement is a requirement for all suppliers to adhere to our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGPs), and all agricultural ingredient suppliers to comply with our Sustainable\nAgriculture Guiding Principles (SAGPs), which set out compliance requirements for all suppliers, including requirements on water management, and minimizing water quality impacts\nfrom wastewater discharges and erosion, and nutrient/agrochemical runoff. Suppliers demonstrate SAGP compliance primarily by receiving certification from sustainable ingredient\nsourcing certification schemes with whom we work together or support. These sustainable agriculture standards and assurance schemes all include extensive water management\nrequirements, including water pollutant management, from measuring abstractions, implementing water efficient irrigation technologies and managing run-off. The Farm Sustainability\nAssessment of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform, the Bonsucro sustainable sugarcane standard and Rainforest Alliance certifications are some of the leading standards\nwe support. Suppliers are audited on their compliance with these principles on a yearly basis.In all geographies and areas in which we operate, the use of water is impacted by local regulations and regulatory frameworks. Without effective governance and regulations,\nsustainable water use in some cases could come under risk. Additionally, effective regulation could unlock many opportunities and benefits for both the local communities and\nbusiness, potentially impacting community well-being, business productivity and levels of cost and capacity. We conduct global, plant-level water risk assessments to inform our global\nwater strategy on an approximate triennial frequency, across a 10-year risk horizon, which is then reviewed and updated annually.

Our finished products are sold to customers, which can be very large to very small retailers (grocery stores), restaurants, hotels, catering\ncompanies, leisure and entertainment parks etc. As a result, customers' voices and requirements are vital in considering our water-related policies, risks and strategies. The following\nare examples of our methods of engagement with customers in water-related risk assessments and relevant examples: - As significant water users in their own operations: for\nexample, Hotels and catering businesses tend to use a lot of water and we have engaged with a number of our leading customers (e.g. Hilton Group) in the US and Europe to help\nthem understand their water risks, share our approaches and advise on water efficiency. - As major indirect users of water through their supply chains, agricultural produce is a major\nwater user for many of our retail customers, e.g. in their fresh produce supply chain. We seek to engage customers on sustainable agriculture where we have common supply chains,\nfor example on fruit (for fresh and juice). For example, in Spain (Huelva region), we helped bring together retail customers like Migros and M&S to work with us and our suppliers on\nwater-efficient strawberry farming. - As a major touchpoint for awareness raising on water with consumers: Retailers are the touchpoint of our brands with the consumers. We engage\ncustomers to partner on the Point of Sales to raise awareness on water with our consumers. For example, we supported Metro Group in a multi-country consumer activation on world\nwater day to raise awareness and funds for water projects in India.Employee engagement is critical for the success of our business and the achievement of water goals. We engage our employees across the system to embed our business objectives\nin the day-to-day way of doing business, especially as we have such a vast operational footprint. Also, employee engagement surveys show how important our work on sustainability,\nincluding water, is for employee loyalty and engagement. Our method of engagement is as follows: We inform and engage employees on water in different ways, through our intranet\n(Connect) or corporate website, internal newsletters (company and bottlers), specific communications on major water events like World Water Day, Global Water Summit and\nStockholm Water Week. Depending on what works best on local level, we also take employees on community days to water projects and field visits to support our partners and raise\nawareness. environmental awards for our bottlers include water performance and reward best in class and best performer bottlers.

Our\nmethod for engagement with local water utilities is through sharing knowledge and best practice. In several regions, for example in sub-saharan Africa, the local water utilies have\nmajor capability challenges , especially around leakage management, non-revenue water, waste water treatment etc. Our bottling partners (e.g. CCBA, CCHBC) work with the local\nregulators and utilities to share knowledge and best practice. In Capetown, our local bottler Coca-Cola Peninsula Beverages worked actively with the local utility on developing an\nalternative water supply strategy and to reduce supply pressure on the municipal provider. As part of our access to water program, the RAIN (Replenish Africa Initiative) is supporting\nwork led by WSUP (Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor, for example in Madagascar, to strengthen the utility of the capital and enable it to expand services to 480.000\nunderserved people.Other\nstakeholder,\nplease specifyRelevant,\nalways\nincludedOur source water protection program requires that each facility, as part of their source water vulnerability assessment, evaluate public sector local and regional water resource master\nand long-term planning.

Step 1 is a global enterprise water risk assessment, using WRI Aqueduct, covering all production facilities globally. The work assesses baseline water stress, projected water\nstress to 2030, water quality challenges and access to water and sanitation (WASH) challenges, for direct operations and key agricultural commodities. Step 2 is to overlay relevant data points such as population data and urbanization rates and to understand and prioritize our work.  Our latest such work is the basis of our\ndisclosure in this response, for facilities and ingredient sourcing regions located in areas of water stress. It is repeated on a triennial basis, or as conditions warrant. Step 3 is to collect plant-level feedback of potential risks in a Facility Water Vulnerability Assessment. The assessment covers 72 potential vulnerabilities across 20 risk\ncategories, completed by our local teams in every geography of operation, the assessment splits into the following six thematic areas:  1. Supply reliability, 2. Water\nefficiency, 3. Water Economics, 4. Product Quality and Safety 5.  Watershed sustainability, 6. Local / Social Issues.Step 4 is to apply our global standards on water resource sustainability, which, based on findings from the assessments above, require all production facilities to: 1. Form a\nwater resource management team; 2. With expert(s), complete a Source Vulnerability Assessment (SVA) to inventory and fully assess all identified risks; 3. Prepare a Source\nWater Protection Plan (SWPP) with actions, roles, responsibilities and funding needs; 4. Implement the SWPP; and 5. Review the SVA and SWPP annually. The outcomes have informed decision-making as per below:The categorization of water stress-levels resulting from Steps 1 and 2 (WRI Aqueduct water-risk mapping and further prioritization by data overlays) have allowed the\nbusiness to segment our global facility locations in order of priority, creating the foundation for our business to explore context-based water targets, based on the requirements\nof each local context.  Additionally, the local assessments in Steps 3 and 4, following from the water-risk mapping, provide an indication of where and what kinds of projects\nthe business should invest in locally, in order to help regenerate watersheds and replenish the water that we use in our operations. For example, much of India faces high to\nextremely high water stress, according to WRI, and TCCC has 9 owned bottling facilities in the country located in such areas. Taking these outcomes and identifying the\nspecific, local needs for protecting source water and managing vulnerabilities, the local team has identified a multitude of ongoing initiatives and projects. As one example,\ncapturing seasonal monsoon rains, for example through the construction of check dams and rainwater harvesting structures, is critical in rural area to address flooding and\nquality impacts of stormwater. Since 2009, The Coca-Cola India Foundation has created more than 13 billion liters of water replenishment potential through 150 community\nwater conservation projects, impacting over 600,000 lives across 500+ villages in remote and water-stressed areas across India.In our value chain, we assess the implications of water risk to our key commodities and raw materials first using WRI Aqueduct. We make a global assessment of the sourcing\nregions of our agricultural commodities that we purchase, and the water stress levels of those geographies in order to map and prioritize our efforts. In addition, we apply\nseveral criteria such as spend, strategic importance, and sustainability risk to prioritize the ingredients we track. We are currently tracking 13 global priority ingredients\nrepresenting about 80% of our total annual agricultural ingredient purchases.As our method of engagement, we require all agricultural suppliers to adhere to our Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGPs), which set out compliance\nrequirements for all suppliers, including requirements on water management, and minimizing water quality impacts from wastewater discharges and erosion, and\nnutrient/agrochemical runoff.  Suppliers demonstrate SAGP compliance primarily by receiving certification from sustainable ingredient sourcing certification schemes with\nwhom we work together or support. These sustainable agriculture standards and assurance schemes all include extensive water management requirements. The Farm\nSustainability Assessment of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform, the Bonsucro sustainable sugarcane standard and Rainforest Alliance certifications are some of\nthe leading standards we support. Suppliers are audited on their compliance with these principles on a yearly basis. Of our 13 global priority ingredients, in 2019, 54% of\nthese ingredient volumes were SAGP-compliant (up from 8% in 2013, the beginning of the program).CDPPage 19 of 58\f"

      "value": "W4. Risks and opportunitiesW4.1W4.1a(W4.1a) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business? We define \u2018substantive impact\u2019 as an event that will probably occur or we expect to occur within a three year horizon and has the potential to result in a materially adverse\naffect on our business, financial condition, results of our operations and result in significant loss to the environment or community services and well-being of the communities\nwe serve. The Company has robust internal processes and an effective internal control environment that facilitate the identification and management of risks. At a central level, this is\nconducted primarily by a robust, cross-functional and cross-company (including our bottling partners) Enterprise Risk Management program and Risk Steering Committee,\n which conducts regular assessments of risk, including an annual update of key enterprise risks. Potential risks factors are gathered from across all functions and\norganizations across the global system (group of organizations including our bottling partners), classified within a risk taxonomy of composed of 22 risk categories across 5\nthematic areas: Strategic and Reputational, People, Operational, Political and Regulatory, and Macro / Economic. Within these thematic areas and risk categories, the impact\nof water and sustainability issues are embedded as either risk categories on their own, as key factors acting as multipliers, or as accelerators of existing business risk\ncategories.Each risk item is given a likelihood score and a consequence score, on a 5-point scale, 1 being the lowest, and 5 being the highest.  Based on the combination of likelihood\nscore  and consequence score, each potential risk event is ranked and management actions are considered.On the likelihood scale, two factors are considered when determining the score: the estimated time horizon and the probability of the risk event. The risk event is then given a\nscore of 1 to 5: (1 - Rare, 2 - Unlikely, 3 - Possible, 4 - Likely, 5 - Almost Certain)On the consequence scale, each risk event is considered against 7 factors to arrive at the score: Financial, Strategy and Business Planning, Reputation, Political and\nRegulatory, Health Safety and Environment, Operational objectives, and People.  The risk event is then given a score of 1 to 5: (1 - Insignificant, 2 - Minor, 3 - Moderate, 4 -\nMajor, 5 - Critical)In the consequence score, one of the 7 factors to provide input into the final score is Financial impact (as noted above). The thresholds to determine these inputs on financial\nimpact are: 1 (Insignificant) - less than 1% of Operating Income [OI]; 2 (Minor) - 2% of OI; 3 (Moderate) - 3% of OI; 4 (Major) - 4% of OI; 5 (Critical) - greater than 5% of OI.In the likelihood score,  time horizon is one of two inputs to determine the final score, as noted above. The thresholds for time horizon are: 1 (Rare) - greater than 10 years, 2\n(Unlikely) - 6 - 10 years, 3 (Possible) - 3 - 6 years, 4 (Likely) - 1 - 3 years, 5 (Almost Certain) - 0 - 12 months. The  thresholds for probability are:  1 (Rare) - <10%, 2 (Unlikely)\n- 10 - 40%, 3 (Possible) - 41 - 70%, 4 (Likely) - 71 - 90%, 5 (Almost Certain) - >90%. \nThese scales apply for both our direct operations and our supply chains, as the scope of assessment of the 5 thematic areas (Strategic and Reputational, People,\nOperational, Political and Regulatory, and Macro / Economic) covers the full potential impact on our business, across our value chain. Risk events that score 3 or above on both scales, based on the aggregation of all inputs, or an equivalent score based on case-specific considerations are given attention for\nmanagement action discussion in the Risk Steering Committee, a cross-functional and cross-company (including bottling partners) committee,  which conducts regular\nassessments of risk, including an annual update of key enterprise risks.  Substantive change is when the scoring for a specific risk event shifts on either the consequence or\nlikelihood score, based either on our own mitigating actions, or due to other factors. An example of substantive impact considered in 2019 was in Pakistan. Due to groundwater depletion, the Chief Justice of Pakistan decided to impose a charge of Rs. 1 (USD\n0.85c) per extracted liter on beverage companies. The potential impact on The Coca-Cola Company was estimated to be approximately $28MM at that time. However,\nimportantly, the levy did not appear to be addressing the cause of the problem meaningfully. The Coca-Cola Company engaged stakeholders and government officials on 2\npoints: One was to expand the proposed levy, in order to ensure that a greater proportion of the overall water usage is covered, and therefore to ensure that the levy would\nhave a meaningful impact. Another point was to drive improvements by introducing  incentives for efficient water consumption. In early 2020, the Punjab Water Bill was\npassed, which authorized the creation of a Water Regulation and Development Authority to effectively manage and conserve water resources of the state.

A number of\nfacilities across India have been identified to be located in areas of high water stress, based on our assessment with WRI aqueduct. 10 facilities in India were identified,\nspread across Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka. However, given the level of baseline water\nstress identified, there is a likelihood that, without any mitigation activity, the production or production capacity of these facilities could be affected by a number of potential\nrisks, such as rising costs, community conflicts, government regulations and others.Country/Area & River basinIndiaOther, please specify (Ganges-Brahmaputra, India East Coast, Krishna, Sabarmati)Type of risk & Primary risk driverPhysicalIncreased water stressPrimary potential impact\nIncreased operating costsTimeframe\nMore than 6 yearsMagnitude of potential impact\nMedium-highLikelihood\nVery likelyAre you able to provide a potential financial impact figure?\nYes, an estimated rangePotential financial impact figure (currency)\n<Not Applicable>Potential financial impact figure - minimum (currency)\n811000000Potential financial impact figure - maximum (currency)\n946000000Explanation of financial impact\nThe amount listed here is the value of current business revenue that is dependent on only the production facilities OWNED BY The Coca-Cola Company, located in India.\nAssumptions below: - Net operating revenue (publicly reported) for the BIG Operating Group is used as a starting point. - Assumes that revenue impact breaks down\nproportional to share of volume produced at a production facility. Much of this volume information is publicly available information. - The low end of the range assumes that\nonly locations with Extremely High water stress are exposed. - The high end of the range assumes that locations with both High and Extremely High water stress are\nexposed. - Estimated exposure was calculated by taking BIG Operating Group revenue, multiplying the volume share of India, and further multiplying the proportion of total\nvolume of the market, that are produced at the facilities in focus.Primary response to risk\nAdopt water efficiency, water reuse, recycling and conservation practicesDescription of response\nWe closely monitor the impact of our water use, and require all plants to comprehensively evaluate local source water vulnerabilities and risk. Each facility is required to\ncomplete a comprehensive risk assessment, composed of 72 risk factors across 21 risk categories on water-related issues, in which the salient issues surrounding its\noperations are comprehensively addressed. The local teams then take the results of this risk assessment, and implement mitigation and management plans. In India, a\nnumber of our bottling facilities lie in areas that considered to be under Extremely High, or High water stress, according to the WRI's aquedeuct tool. As such, the\nmanagement and mitigation actions are focused on increasing water availability and increasing water efficiency. For example, at Mehandiganj plant in Varanasi district of\nUttar Pradesh, local NGOs and Hindustan Coca-Cola installed the first rainwater harvesting project nearly 15 years ago. Since then, the partnership has commissioned 38\nrainwater harvesting structures to recharge ground water. We continue to improve water efficiency in our plants including introducing water reuse technology. Additionally,\nsince 2009, Anandana\u2014The Coca-Cola India Foundation\u2014has created more than 13 billion liters of water replenishment potential through 150 community water\nconservation projects, impacting over 600,000 lives across 500+ villages in remote and water-stressed areas across the country. The projects emphasize community\nparticipation with a focus on women, who often reach supervisory roles in village \u201cPani Samitis\u201d (water committees), to ensure the maintenance and sustainability of the\ncommunity water projects.Explanation of cost of response\nIn 2019, we conducted 326 projects worldwide to restore watersheds and help replenish the equivalent amount of water we withdraw from these watersheds into our\nproducts. As a result, we replenished 161% of the volume of water we used in our beverages, equating to approximately 274 billion liters, through ecosystem restoration and\nwatershed remediation projects. The cumulative volume of water replenished since this program was announced more than a decade ago, is over 1.5 trillion liters of water,\nand the cumulative cost of these projects is indicated above as \"Cost of response to risk.\" The calculation is the sum of project budgets for these projects, which exceeds\nUSD 300,000,000.Cost of response\n300000000W4.2aCDPPage 24 of 58\f"

Our business uses a significant volume of corn-derived\nsweetener, high fructose corn syrup, as a sweetener in our beverages in many of key markets, including the United States of America. If the production of corn is impacted,\na significant portion of our product portfolio in this market will be directly impacted, through cost and availability impacts of a key ingredient. Roughly 29% of of our global\nportfolio is now low or no-calories. The remainder of that portfolio uses either sugar or corn-derived sweetener. Specifically, in the United States, these products use corn-\nderived sweeteners, nearly all grown in the United States. Based on our climate-related priority risk assessment, we understand that the chronic physical impacts of climate\nchange, namely changes in precipitation patterns, temperature variability and changes in weather patterns, are expected to have a significant impact on our agricultural\nsupply chains, which will be felt through the variability in the availability and stress of water resources. Through product water footprinting exercises, we also have\nascertained that for some of our products, 80% of our water use sits within the agricultural supply chain, making this portion of our water usage particularly significant. As a\nresult of these assessments, we understand that if the production of corn is impacted in the United States, a significant portion of our product portfolio in the US will be\ndirectly impacted, potentially increasing cost and creating challenges on the availability of sourcing for a key ingredient. We therefore consider the water-related risks in the\ngrowing (i.e. sourcing) of this raw material to be a critical risk to monitor and understand.Timeframe\n4-6 yearsLikelihood\nLikelyMagnitude of potential impact\nHighAre you able to provide a potential financial impact figure?\nYes, an estimated rangePotential financial impact figure (currency)\n<Not Applicable>Potential financial impact figure - minimum (currency)\n1580000000Potential financial impact figure - maximum (currency)\n4552000000Explanation of financial impact\nThis is the amount of current revenue that is dependent specifically on corn sourced from the United States, which is the scope of this risk calculation. Assumptions below: -\nNet operating revenue (public data) for North America Operating Group is used as an input. - USA revenue breaks down proportional to its UC volume share within the NA\nOG. - Global percentage of low or no-calorie beverages in our portfolio (29%) is applicable as an average to the USA market. - Low end of range = exposed to risk only in\nlocations of extremely high water stress. - High end of range = exposed to risk in locations of both high and extremely high water stress. Estimated exposure was calculated\nby taking North America Operating Group revenue, multiplying the volume share of USA, and further applying % of portfolio that use corn-derived sweetener, based on\nassumption above. We then multiply the % of our corn that we believe may be exposed to risk due to water stress based on climate change impacts.Primary response to riskSupplier engagementOther, please specify (Drive the adoption of sustainable sourcing certification by suppliers as a way of improving the resilience of our agricultural supply chains, )Description of response\nIn 2013, we set a goal to more sustainably source our priority ingredients by 2020. Corn is one of our priority ingredients, in the form of High Fructose Corn Syrup. We\nrequire that our suppliers meet our 15 Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGP), which establish the framework for progress and are integrated into governance\nprocurement processes. As a case study specifically on corn, we advance our sustainable sourcing through membership in Field to Market: The Alliance for Sustainable\nAgriculture, through which we work on more sustainable corn production in the United States. With our four biggest corn suppliers, we are aiming to fulfill a 2014\ncommitment to expand the application of Field to Market\u2019s Fieldprint\u00ae Platform, a data-driven tool that quantifies water use, energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and\nother measures of sustainability performance. The target is to engage corn farmers representing 1 million acres by 2020, which would position The Coca-Cola Company\nwith 100% more sustainable corn production in the U.S. market. As a result of such work, our global % of corn sourced from sustainable sources has moved into the 51 -\n75% range, up from 0 - 25% in 2016 and 2017.Cost of response\n100000Explanation of cost of response\nThe cost of response to this risk is the total annual contribution from The Coca-Cola Company's to select platforms such as Field to Market, or the SAI platform to promote\nthe advancement of sustainable sourcing and raise awareness at a global level.CDPPage 25 of 58\f"

      "value": "(W4.3) Have you identified any water-related opportunities with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?\nYes, we have identified opportunities, and some/all are being realized(W4.3a) Provide details of opportunities currently being realized that could have a substantive financial or strategic impact on your business.W4.3W4.3aType of opportunity\nEfficiencyPrimary water-related opportunity\nImproved water efficiency in operationsCompany-specific description & strategy to realize opportunity\nThe Coca-Cola system uses about 300 billion liters of water across 800+ bottling facilities annually. To enhance our understanding of the impacts of climate change and\nwater-related impacts, we undertook a risk assessment, which has helped us to identify climate and water-related risks and opportunities. The risk that water-related\nregulations (e.g. changes in the price of water or restrictions on water supply) may impact our operations has been identified as a material risk, as a result of this work. In\naddition to procurement cost, water must undergo multiple additional treatment processes (RO, carbon, polishing, UV etc.), which create significant operating cost .\nTherefore, Water efficiency is strategic for our company because there is an opportunity and a financial incentive, to reduce water consumption and enhance water\nefficiency within our own operations. A fundamental pillar of our water stewardship work is managing the water use in our worldwide bottling plants. We are doing this by\ninvesting in water efficient technologies and by introducing new technologies which help to reduce our use of water. To realize this opportunity, we have a goal to reduce\nour water efficiency by 25 percent over 2010 levels by 2020. In 2019, our water efficiency improved for the 17th consecutive year, with a 2 percent improvement over 2018,\nand an improvement of more than 30 percent since 2004. We work in partnership with our bottling partners and business units globally to drive toward this goal, including\nmandatory tracking and reporting on progress on our internal KPI for this measure, which we refer to as \"Water-use ratio,\" which measures the the ratio of water used per\nlitre of product produced. One of our largest bottling partners, Coca-Cola European Partners, in 2018 \u20ac2.7 million was invested in water efficient technologies and\nprocesses, resulting in water savings of 75,170 m\u00b3. In 2018, at the Furstenfeldbruck manufacturing site in Germany an investment in water efficient bottle washers, saved\nup to 1,400 m3 of water per month. In Spain, our Barcelona site introduced a new system to reuse wastewater in 2018, which helped regenerate the ecosystem of a nearby\nlagoon and increased the biodiversity of aquatic flora and fauna.Estimated timeframe for realization\nMore than 6 yearsMagnitude of potential financial impact\nMedium-highAre you able to provide a potential financial impact figure?\nYes, a single figure estimatePotential financial impact figure (currency)\n1000000000Potential financial impact figure \u2013 minimum (currency)\n<Not Applicable>Potential financial impact figure \u2013 maximum (currency)\n<Not Applicable>W5.

Overall our CAPEX in these priority markets increased 126.3% compared to the previous year mainly due to the construction of a major\nwater quality unit in the US and several large investments in India in surface water tanks and check dams. OPEX has remained steady with a slight decrease of 0.7%\ncompared to the previous year because while we closed several projects in the US in 2019, it was offset by 19 new water-related projects coming online in India. Water-\nrelated expenditure for CAPEX in 2019 was for water quality and waste water treatment systems, a chiller-condenser, surface water tanks and check dams. Water-related\nexpenditure for OPEX in 2019 was for the ongoing maintenance of these new systems and continued operations of similar projects constructed in previous years.(W7.3) Does your organization use climate-related scenario analysis to inform its business strategy?In 2018, building on our work with BSR in 2016/17 to create a framework for climate resilience at The Coca-Cola Company, we conducted a thorough climate-related risk priority assessment. The\nassessment was conducted in partnership with DNV GL and Coca-Cola European Partners and was conducted in alignment with the recommendations of the Taskforce for Climate-related\nFinancial Disclosures. It assessed Acute physical, Chronic physical and Transitional risks across a 10-year timescale, through a host of internal and external information and interviews, and\nidentified both a BAU and 2 degree scenario for scenario analysis.(W7.3a) Has your organization identified any water-related outcomes from your climate-related scenario analysis?\nYes(W7.3b) What water-related outcomes were identified from the use of climate-related scenario analysis, and what was your organization\u2019s response?Description of possible water-related outcomesCompany response to possible water-related outcomesThe identified priority water-related risks are split between the two scenarios. In a \"BAU\"\nworld, for which we used the IEA World Energy Outlook \"New Policies\" scenario, the\nfollowing are the top priority risks: - Changes to weather and precipitation patterns limiting\nthe availability of ingredients and raw materials: In the United States, we use corn-derived\nsweeteners. Impact on this agricultural supply chain will be felt through the variability in\nthe availability and stress of water resources, and will impact our ability to produce,\nresulting in a potential total financial exposure of USD1.88-4.55 billion, based on the\namount of revenue dependent on this commodity. - Water scarcity disrupting sourcing\nand/or production: In India, we have 10 facilities that are located in areas considered to\nbe either Extremely high or High in water stress. This means we have a total potential\nfinancial exposure of 811 - 964 million USD, based on the amount of revenue generated\nwithin those regions. In a \"2-Degree\" world, the following are considered the primary\nrisks, as well as some of the above risks, to a lesser degree, continuing to have impacts: -\nGHG and/or water regulations increasing COGS (GHG) or disrupting production (Water) -\nChanges to consumer perceptions affecting corporate reputationThroughout 2019, a comprehensive review of our global strategy was conducted, with participation from\nall geographies, business units and key bottling partners, on a time horizon of 2030. In this long-term\nstrategy review, the following long-term water-related issues were considered: - Heightened Water-\nStress - Deteriorating Water Quality - Potential Growth Limitations - Higher Business Demand for Water -\nGrowing Exposure to Supply Chain Water Risks - Social License to operate - Regulation and Taxation\nThe water-related outcomes of our climate-related scenario analysis were integrated into the review of\nour global strategy framework. As a result, a strong link between the impacts of climate change and\nwater-related outcomes has been drawn, and our management of the water-related outcomes of climate\nchange features as a key component of our global water sustainability strategy. Specifically, this means\nthat our global water risk assessments, our Facility Water Vulnerability Assessment, and Source\nVulnerability Assessments, which are the key components of our updated global water sustainability\nstrategy, will feature climate change impacts as a core element against which to assess our risks. This\nupdated strategy will roll out in 2021, and all assessments and targets will be set on a 2030 timeline.\nBased on our facility and geography-specific risk assessments, our updated strategy will feature\ncontext-specific targets, tying in the various long-term impacts above.W7.3CommentUse of\nclimate-\nrelated\nscenario\nanalysisYesRow\n1W7.3aW7.3bRow\n1Climate-\nrelated\nscenarios\nand\nmodels\nappliedOther,\nplease\nspecify\n(IEA WEO\nNew\nPolicies\nScenario,\nREMIND\nIAM 2C\nScenario)W7.4CDPPage 53 of 58\f"

Priority ingredients include cane and beet sugar, high fructose corn syrup, stevia, tea, coffee,\noranges, lemons, grapes, apples, mangos, pulp and paper fiber for packaging, palm oil and soy. The company is implementing this goal company-wide by asking all of our\nsuppliers of our priority ingredients to demonstrate they are meeting our Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles by using global sustainable agriculture standards and\nassurance schemes that are aligned with these such as the Bonsucro sustainable sugarcane standard and Rainforest Alliance certifications.Progress\nThe measure by which we track and monitor our progress is through certification with third party platforms that are proven to comply with and promote the necessary\npractices to achieve our sustainability ambitions, as well as our Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles, a comprehensive set of principles to which all suppliers are\nrequired compliance. Therefore, the indicator to assess progress against this goal is the % of our sourcing that is certified to be sustainable, through our approved list of\ncertifications. We continue to work towards our goal of 100% of priority ingredients being certified as sustainable. In 2019 we sourced 69% of our beet sugar, 32% of our\ncane sugar, and 67% of our corn sustainably; 82 and 90% of our globally sourced tea and coffee, respectively, from sustainable sources. Some secondary indicators of the\nscale of the program are as follows: we are currently tracking SAGP compliance of 13 global priority ingredients, which represent about 80% of our total annual agricultural\ningredient purchases. In 2019, 54% of these ingredient volumes were SAGP-compliant (up from 8% in 2013, the beginning of the program). Challenges we have faced\ninclude regulated markets with little sustainability traction, social issues at the farm level, and limited knowledge of sustainability practice by and fragmentation of\nsmallholder farmers.W8.1bLevel\nCompany-wideMotivation\nRisk mitigationBaseline year\n2013Start year\n2014End year\n2020W9.

Total water used is the total of all water used by the Coca-Cola\nsystem in all global production facilities and co-located distribution centers, from all sources, including municipal, well, surface water, and collected rain water. This\nincludes water used for: production; water treatment; boiler makeup; cooling (contact and non-contact); cleaning and sanitation; backwashing filters; irrigation; washing\ntrucks and other vehicles; kitchen or canteen; toilets and sinks; and fire control. This does not include return water or non-branded bulk water donated to the community.\nLiters of product produced include all production, not just saleable. products. The intent of the replenish program is to develop a global portfolio of Community Water\nPartnership (CWP) projects that yield an annual volumetric water benefit equivalent to the company\u2019s annual global sales volume. Water replenish is defined as the ratio\nof water safely provided to communities and to nature by the community water partnership portfolio divided by sales volume of company beverage products as disclosed\nin the 2018 10-K (refer to Note B). This methodology takes into account that all wastewater from the processes is safely returned to the environment according to our\nstandards. Volumetric project benefits are quantified using TCCC\u2019s peer reviewed methodology as outlined in the Corporate Water Stewardship: Achieving a Sustainable\nBalance paper published in the Journal of Management and Sustainability in November 2013. Last year, we worked with a coalition of companies and partners to\nestablish an industry-wide approach to replenishment quantification, the Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting, which was published in September 2019.W10.
